Firstly, I took up an interest in Consulting lately and would like to explore how the field truly work by working on actual projects rather than reading books and articles about it. The most important reason, however, is impact. It's a rather known fact that businesses, especially small businesses, are declining due to the destructive impact of COVID-19. They suffer from decreased profits, low customer retention, being out-phased by technological advancements to which some can't keep up with, and many more challenges. My cousin actually has a small business, and he suffers from some of these factors stated above, and I understand how COVID has affected his means of livelihood, which I'd assume is the case for a lot of small business owners.

As I watched my four older role models make decisions and choose the choices they did, it quickly became second nature to wonder why they made the decisions they did, for the good and the bad; the word “why?” became a staple in my vocabulary. I’ve found that this inquisitive habit has guided my own choices and encouraged me to continually find new ways to challenge any decisions already made and find ways to continuously find better solutions, leading me to pursue an undergraduate business degree so I can develop the necessary skills to go into consulting post-grad. As president of the Teen Board of the Ronald McDonald House of Charlotte, I was able to connect with numerous organizations in my community to set up fundraisers and events such as the annual Holiday House. I believe this experience has helped me with not only more leadership roles but also with building new relationships with additional organizations. I hope that I can transfer these skills that I have learned in my to this club and eventually to a consulting company so I can further help my community.","Throughout my high school career, I made it a priority to become involved in teaming opportunities that gave back to the community wherever I could.

I remember feeling just as ecstatic as the donor whenever we got the notification that their blood has been used in a certain hospital. As I work through a CYC engagement, I’ll be able to see how my efforts are making a difference. I want to establish a strong connection with the owners and take my time with the team to walk through issues they are having. It will be heartwarming to see small businesses grow from the team’s efforts and see how they implemented solutions we designed. 
 
I value teamwork, and a large portion of CYC is working together to brainstorm solutions. I believe I can bring my unique skill set to CYC, and utilize my strengths to make the team stronger. I will also benefit from interacting with a team from diverse backgrounds and fields of studies. With this, I can also build upon skills that I’m not very familiar with. Specifically within the roles of strategy and finance, as they go hand-in-hand with my accounting degree. This is a great opportunity for me to step outside of my comfort zone and gain real-world experience that could be used towards my professional goals.

By establishing a strong bond with the clients and the engagement team, operations will run smoothly and it will be easier to keep contact with them in the future.
 
In addition, working at Starbucks has helped me learn how to resolve a wide range of issues. From crafting 150+ drinks a day to resolving customer concerns in the drive-thru, I have gained significant customer service experience. I’ve learned how to actively listen and respond to a situation calmly and respectfully. 
 
Building off this, working in a fast-paced, high pressure environment at Starbucks has taught me to adapt quickly to situations and problem-solve. A way I’ve utilized this expertise is by participating in a mask project for WakeMed Cary and Raleigh hospital over quarantine. I created fit-frames for KN-95 masks, which would allow people to have a tight fit to their mask. I was given beads, string, and a small platform with holes in a ziploc bag. Through experimentation, I discovered a way to connect these pieces and mass assemble fit frames.

In addition to that, I grew up listening to conversations of my family members who are all self-employed.  Through listening, I’ve gained a lot of valuable knowledge that could help me to assist others in ways to grow and market their businesses. This excites me since I am eager to get hands on experience while helping others achieve their goals.  In conclusion, I feel as though I will be able to give valuable insight to each engagement regarding the situation at hand.

As a business major, this is a wonderful opportunity for me to get hands-on experience in the business world. I am super stoked about CYC's cause as it is personally important to me because my mom is local POC-business owner in Chapel Hill and growing up I was able to learn the ins and outs of local business from her and think an experience like this is helpful for students as well as business owners, it can have a huge impact. I also want to engage with other students interested in consulting or business that want to use their skills for non-profits due to my interest in government and non-profit organizations.

As a landscape architect, I will work on projects in affordable housing, mixed use developments, and urban green spaces. Broadly, this means creating a stronger, more vibrant community. Of course, I can’t tackle this huge task all at once–it has to be done site by site, project by project. CYC functions in a very similar way, which is why I want to be a part of the organization and help the small business owners in my own backyard. My lifelong goal is to establish my own firm, and I hope to gain insights in entrepreneurship through CYC engagements. Consulting is a crucial part of community building and I’m excited to improve my professional skills that I can use in my future career.  

CYC is a unique opportunity to elevate the people in my community while honing my skills and connecting with like-minded peers. In my work and personal projects, I love identifying and correcting inefficiencies. I’m always looking for ways to improve myself and the world around me, and I want to channel that energy into real-world business projects.

Although the worst of the pandemic-induced recession is behind us, many businesses are still struggling to adapt to this dynamic market. COVID is still contributing to inflation and economic uncertainty, and I want to help our city’s small business owners adapt to and overcome these challenges. On the other hand, the pandemic has actually benefited certain industries and even created new ones, and I’m excited to work with these businesses so that they can continue to enjoy their newfound success. ","My profession is the perfect combination of art and science. My goal is to bring both of these values to my CYC engagements so that my business solutions are both data-driven and creative. Landscape architecture is also incredibly multidisciplinary, which means that I can adapt to any CYC engagement and concentrate my efforts where I’m needed most. 

In terms of technical skills, I’m capable of reading and interpreting financial statements and I’m also proficient in Excel and statistical analysis. I’m a fast, independent learner and I’m not afraid to ask when I don’t know the answer. Although I’m not a business major, I can speak the language of business and I enjoy breaking down complex problems. I don’t consider myself strictly an analyst or a people person because I'm an ideal balance of both. I understand that being on an engagement team doesn’t just mean working with a business, it means working with a person and their livelihood. By starting with this sense of empathy in mind, I believe that I can stay focused on the client’s needs and deliver the maximum amount of benefit. I love to face challenges, and the more I’m challenged, the more enthusiasm I bring and the more determined I become. I aim to bring value to CYC through my previous leadership experience, willingness to learn, and holistic approach to consulting.

Clubs are important. However, I personally have never been intrigued by the reason for joining clubs. CYC is the first club, after months of searching,  that appealed to me at NC state, and the first club that I am fully interested in joining. The thought of consulting smaller businesses and helping businesses is an action that I have always enjoyed. To me, I have been lucky to have some sort of helping hand come along with me ever since I started high school. Helping people or even organizations was my motivation to become happy. Seeing organizations or people thrive due to my help and actions is what made me who I am today as an open-minded, out-going individual. With hands-on experience at the hospital or volunteering at events, I have always had some sort of base at using my time to help others. The goal of CYC helping small business owners and doing their best to help the community really is something that I would love to be a part of. With my dad being a software consultant, I have learned many new aspects of consulting, understood consulting in real-world scenarios, and even shadowed my dad through his works and many projects to gain some sort of expertise in consulting. The resources and experiences available with CYC will help me gain more exposure and experience in a future career, hopefully, a career in the business and financial concentration preparing me for whatever my future holds. CYC is the perfect place for me to explore and use the skills, experience, and knowledge I have learned over the years. ","I personally see myself bringing a lot of value to the CYC environment some of which are communication skills. By having lead positions at summer camps and a lead position at the hospital, communication skills are something that I just naturally came with and improved throughout the years. For me, being able to make everybody feel inclusive is something I have always been passionate about. When I was younger, I always felt excluded from whatever activities I was involved in such as basketball games, classroom activities, or a group of friends. The thought of being excluded from whatever activities or events has always scared me and I would never want to watch any member or person feel that way while participating in activities. My most important value that I see myself bringing to the CYC environment is inclusion and doing my best to help all members of the club feel welcome, included, and involved no matter what race, background, etc. I also hope to bring some my knowledge to the table learned from my dad’s job to the small businesses that would benefit from consulting. With the involvement in this club, I will be more proactive and engaged in the community by finding ways to improve smaller businesses and ways to improve my skill sets.

The shows would depict the struggles of the small-business owners before Lemonis would step in and retool their entire business plan, often starting from the ground up. He focused on his so-called 3 p's of any business: people, process, and product. And with that, he would go and fix exactly as stated: the product, the process, and sometimes even the people running the business.
It was this show that matured my love of business, and has made me yearn to open my own business in the future. While I can't achieve this goal just yet, CYC offers me the chance to work with current business owners and help them achieve their goals. I believe that this experience will give me everything that I need to open my own business in the future. Working through the problems of business will leave me well-prepared to tackle these challenges when I encounter them in the future.
Furthermore, with the impact that Covid has had on many small businesses, I feel that it is the perfect time to give back to the community in any way. If I am able to help a small-business owner recoup some of their losses during Covid, all while gaining business acumen, and making personal connections with business owners as well as my teammates, joining CYC seems like a no-brainer.","As I laid out in the earlier question, I am well attuned with a business strategy that circles around Marcus Lemonis’ 3 p’s: people, process, and product. People are taken care of in this scenario, as all these business owners are hand-picked by CYC, and are all in need of help with their small business. Where I think I could help is the process and product aspect of business. Bringing problem-solving, quick-thinking, and a great work ethic into the equation, I think that I can work with teammates to effectively solve any problems with the existing product and process. 
A lot of the time, making the product more appealing to the consumer, or making the process in which the product more efficient, will solve a lot of the issues with profit margins, and the monetary aspect of business.
Besides that, I am very trustworthy, reliable, and a good communicator, which makes me an ideal team member, and guarantees that CYC will be a priority to me. WIth that, I look forward to joining CYC and working with the small business owners to satisfy their needs. I look forward to getting uncomfortable and tackling challenging problems with my teammates.

Moreover, I had the chance to study a lot of useful subjects related to a vast array of disciplines, some linked to business administration (e.g., supply chain, finance, and marketing), and others covering the production processes of arts-related goods. This combination gave me a good preparation in a broad context, and a deeper knowledge in specific fields. during my studies, I have always wanted to strengthen my gained knowledge through working in environments where I could exploit what I had previously studied. This is the reason why I chose to find the jobs I got during the years: all of these positions made me reinforce what I studied theoretically, and made me learn new skills. When I was still studying in Italy, there wasn't a student-run ""consulting company""; however, when I arrived here, I immediately came across CYC ads, and I searched for it online.  As soon as I found out what it was all about, I wanted to join this community. By joining this amazing organization, to continue supporting small business owners, bring my knowledge and skills to the community, and get to know more people who share some of my interests! ","One of the most apparent things about me, is the broad set of interests that I carry and try to maintain, in spite of its difficulty. As I started university, I have always enjoyed taking the most diverse classes, and I am still trying to diversify my knowledge, in order to keep refining my well-rounded skills. This ability makes me able to smoothly adapt to new environments, quickly getting over a barrier caused by lack of experience. 
Moreover, I love working with other people, and I always put them on the first place in terms of understanding their needs, and making sure that we are fixing the right problem. With other team members, likewise, I always make sure to work with and listen to everybody, making the most out of everybody's savviness, which ultimately makes me develop my own knowledge. 
In addition, during team works I usually am recognized as the ""creative-thinking one"", as I tend to always find solutions to every problem that comes up, and the more difficult the issue, the more satisfying it is to find a solution. Sometimes I tend to spend a lot of time for fixing minor issues, but in this way I always make sure that nothing is left to chance.

I look forward to having the opportunity to apply what I have learned in courses towards solving problems, while also helping and supporting ideas of minority-owned and small businesses. I hope to have a positive impact on other individuals and the community. The idea of working alongside other individuals from various backgrounds and experiences who share this passion for service excites me. I believe that through working together on solving problems, unique and wonderful solutions can be created, due to the variety of perspectives, ideas, and discussions. I also find the opportunity to form long-term relationships with clients and businesses in the community to be neat.  As I enjoy problem solving and am eager to apply my creativity, I feel that I would enjoy consulting and would therefore like to explore it further. I see CYC as providing me with further opportunities to grow as a leader and individual as well from increased exposure to new problems and teamwork in approaching these. 

My interest in understanding our current economic system, with the hopes of working towards finding solutions and changing the flaws that have allowed for the inequity and wealth gap in our society. CYC is addressing this problem in our society and it provides me the opportunity to begin having a positive and direct impact on my community now, through consulting for local businesses who are under resourced and can’t afford to pay large consulting firms. I know that helping a local business and seeing the difference and impact it has will be very fulfilling for me. It is humbling to know that I can support an individual and their business, which can have a ripple effect in helping so many other individuals and improving places and communities, beginning with my own community.
","I believe my listening skills would be helpful towards understanding the problems clients may be facing as well as grasping applicable details. This would also be beneficial when working together in groups with other students. In group discussion environments I listen to and welcome other thoughts and perspectives, accounting for this in making decisions. I have experience with learning new materials and quickly familiarizing myself with new tools and concepts through research. I would be comfortable and interested in learning any new tools that could be helpful for a CYC engagement. I find it neat how certain concepts can be expressed and understood in different ways.

I have always been fascinated with business, the idea of building something out of an idea and will-power is quintessential to the American dream and the common bond that ties us all together. I enjoy studying trends that successful businesses share and ways to predict their viability and scalability. I hope to gain a deeper understanding of these areas at CYC and contribute to implementing them. I believe in the CYC mission, to empower small businesses and drive change in our community while fostering inclusivity. Last summer I had the chance to attend a TiE Access pitch competition for women and minority owned businesses. This was an eye opener for me, and I was able to see the great things that can happen when professionals come together to build each other up and promote inclusivity and diversity. I will strive to recreate this atmosphere in my work, and I understand that this vision is shared by CYC. The way business brings out the best in people and brings us all together in pursuit of bettering our surroundings is a vision that I want to take part in and something that I am very passionate about.

I take my work very seriously and strive to do the best in everything I take part in, this is something that I have heard is the standard in CYC. My drive will push me to work long hours if necessary in order to complete work at a high standard of quality. I am excited for the chance to contribute to an organization whose culture requires drive and willingness to work hard from all its members. I developed extensive leadership skills from my two years in the NCSU Army ROTC program where I completed training that pushed me past my physical and mental limits in order to build me up a stronger person. In that training, I spent a considerable amount of time working in teams to accomplish difficult tasks under high amounts of stress. The training is designed to imbue one with the ability to work at a high level of focus on the task at hand while taking outside factors into account at the same time. For the past year I’ve been working at Simpliworks, a programmatic advertising company started by NCSU alumni, that provides software and consulting services to Amazon sellers. This has given me experience working on systems design in a fast paced agile scrum environment.
