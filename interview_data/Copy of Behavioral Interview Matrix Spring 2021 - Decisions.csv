After applying and interviewing through two recruitment cycles, my aspirations have only grown stronger. My good impressions and ideas about CYC have been confirmed and exceeded in all of my past interactions. Most importantly, and the reason for my persistency, is that I continue to be impressed by the work CYC does. I'm inspired by the change CYC brings directly to the Raleigh community and it's something a have, and still do, want to be apart of. ","I have a lot to give. I am a team player with an aggressive self-starter attitude. I am constantly thinking of new and innovative ways to better myself and my community. I have a passion for working with other people and am confident in my communication skills in being able to do so. These skills will specifically aid my engagement in CYC and will give me tools to excel in the work I do. I am passionate and invested, qualities I believe to be vital in working closely towards the success of small businesses with real people and real stories.

Starting something from scratch and building it all the way up gives me unparalleled pleasure. When I was in middle school, I was the most under- confident person you could ever meet. It wasn’t until 8th grade that I realised I couldn’t go on like this and needed to do something about it. I started approaching all my teachers for any public speaking opportunity I could get. Teachers were skeptical about sending me anywhere as I wasn't experienced. Since I had never done things like that before, it took me 2 years to reach a stage where I could at least go on a stage without shaking and finally participate in competitions. With time, my confidence grew and I built my space in the school. I realised that there were a lot of people like me- eager, but deprived of opportunity. That is when I became the first person in my school to ever start a club- the TED Ed Club. We received more than 100 applications and the gratification I felt to see the club and its members thrive is indescribable. It is this gratification that I intend to feel again. Till now, all my impact has been limited to school but I want to move beyond that. Joining CYC would be the perfect opportunity for me to do that and build a connection with my own community. 
","As a former female entrepreneur myself, and hence as someone who knows the hardships of running a business full time in and out, I can highly resonate with the clients we are actually going to work with. As a part of my business, I had to bake all the produce from scratch, market it on various platforms like Instagram, Facebook etc, create content for this very marketing, take orders, handle payments, take stock of the capital and get the orders delivered. I fully understand the value of not only financial and logistical support, but also the moral support they need while operating their business. Moreover, as an engineering, especially computer science student, there is a lot that I bring to the table. This is just my first semester but I plan to take classes in the summer and as we proceed, I am going to learn coding languages and other invaluable technical skills that can prove to be very useful to our clients. I think more than my skills, I can be a huge asset by the sheer virtue of the passion and enthusiasm I hold for entrepreneurship.

Joining CYC would allow me to work with like-minded individuals who are ambitious about volunteer work and helping out non-profit businesses in our area. Consulting has always been an interest of mine because of the ability to keep meeting new people and being able to have a strong impact on the company’s goals. If I were to join CYC this would be a great step towards the right direction. My roommate, Pranav Chockalingman, is currently working at CYC and he finds the opportunity to be wonderful. He is able to meet classmates with amazing skills and talents while working to help clients around the area. CYC would be a dream come true. It was one of my top reasons for choosing NC State. Ever since, high school CYC has been a club that I’ve wanted to join.","If I were to join CYC I would be able to help clients with marketing tasks. This past summer I received an internship at Spaces and More located in Hyderabad, India. Here I was tasked to help increase marketing initiatives. Company sales had started to decline due to the pandemic so advertising was a big part of their plan to increase sales. I was tasked with a team of 4 and we developed 3 marketing advertisements. We also optimized the company website. Before the company had a sloppy website with grammatical errors and lack of design flow. Our group helped recreate the design of the website and helped advertise their company through the use of various social media outposts. 
	I am an extremely ambitious student who is goal-oriented and driven to success. I am also a creative thinker and I am able to bring unique ideas to the table. Lastly, I am a big team player. I find it vital to bounce ideas around with a team and receive different perspectives of certain topics.

My long-term goals are to work in the non-profit sector in a policy capacity with a focus in either healthcare or education. Personally though, I feel very close to both North Carolina and using service as means to give back to my community. Previously I volunteered at my elementary school every summer prior to graduating high school and served on various institutional committees, focused on diversity and mental health, for my high school, the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, where I cemented my understanding of the importance of giving back to one’s community when working with the institutional advancement department. At the beginning of the current pandemic, I volunteered on a weekly basis with Catholic Parish Outreach and have continued my previous volunteering commitments to my dance studio. I want to continue these deep ties to my community and give back, while continuing to develop the skills needed to make an impact the social sector in a professional capacity. I want to develop a community of people within NC State of people who value the social and public sector as I do and learn from my peers how to become a more effective leader. After having a brief experience in consulting this summer, I know it is the industry I initially want to enter when graduating. Joining CYC will the provide the opportunity to prepare for this career, while targeting the sector that I am most interested in and aligning with my personal values targeting service. ","In a CYC engagement, I see myself being able to bring a lot to the role of business analyst. A consulting engagement requires both qualitative and quantitative skills, while leveraging communication and organization. I believe my industrial engineering curriculum will provide me the with technical skills that will be able to help me contribute to data analyses. More than this, I have taken part in the Data Matters conference this past fall that allowed me to develop data visualization skills in Tableau and additional tools that help both analysis and presentation. I have also been on a research project regarding COVID-19 operational policies with Dr. Julie Ivy since the beginning of the fall semester which has provided me the experience of having to analyze large qualitative data sets. Additionally, I will also bring my independent and collaborative working style to a CYC engagement. This summer as an intern with McKinsey and Company, I was able to drive my own workstream while still communicating actively with my team for clarification when needed and providing updates in a timely manner. This was done while supporting additional initiatives that my team was presented with. These are skills that been recognized in my current internship with the Hunt Institute as a Policy & Research Intern, where I have been given abstract tasks to support various initiatives and projects and have asked targeted question to receive the necessary information to complete these in an efficient and comprehensive manner. Being an Industrial Engineering Ambassador, I have been put in situations to represent the college’s department in a virtual environment which has allowed me to develop effective communication skills. From my varied experiences, I believe I can bring my time management, analytical, communication, and collaboration skills to CYC engagements.

Growing up I have always been intrinsically  STEM-oriented, but I have always been interested in the business part of any organization. Because of this, I chose to pursue an economics degree alongside my engineering degree, and hope in the future to attend business school and combine my love of science and business to ultimately help others in my community. The diverse perspective of an interdisciplinary mindset allows me to view problems both subjectively and objectively and forces me to slow down and deeper analyze any situation I encounter. While I have all these aspirations, it is extremely difficult to get real-world experience that can show me what to expect from these future plans. Consult your Community is the perfect opportunity for me to not only gain valuable experience in the workings of business but will also allow me to interact with individuals outside of my major, which is a rare commodity. Having lived in Raleigh for all of my life, I am passionate about helping those who call this city their home, and I know that being a part of CYC will be just as beneficial for my own growth as it is for the growth of each small business I work with. ","The perspectives and experiences that individuals bring with them are far more valuable than the knowledge from a course that they may have taken. For an organization that strives to provide support for women and minority business owners, my identity as a woman and minority allows me to bring a mindset that not everyone can inherently have. While I personally have not run a business, I can truly empathize with the struggles of facing discrimination for your identity. Having that compassion behind the consulting work that you are doing is imperative to truly connecting with the client, and is a strong asset to have on your team. I have also had the privilege of working in corporate environments that have allowed me to understand the intricacies of the professional world and how to interact in that setting. From being a high achieving student juggling sports, clubs, volunteering, and working, I have learned to be not only a hard worker but an effective worker as well as a team player. 

From my resume, I possess many qualities and experiences that would be resourceful for CYC, but the biggest value I would bring to an engagement would be my love for Raleigh. Having grown up in Raleigh and now going to school at NC State, the success of local businesses and seeing my city flourish is the driving force behind my desire to be a part of CYC.

Michael Barr wrote a report called “Minority and Women Entrepreneurs: Building Capital, Networks, and Skills” which highlights key statistics of the historical disadvantages that women-and minority-owned businesses have faced, including the fact that “minority-owned businesses are approximately three times as likely to be denied loans as are comparable non minority businesses”. Such statistics are my motivation for wanting to join an organization like CYC because small business success is vital to the growth of our country (potential to “reduce race and gender wealth gaps, to reduce income and wealth inequality, and increase social mobility”). Thus, knowing that I have the opportunity to leverage my knowledge and resources to maximize success within a small business excites me. Kathryn Sharpe mentioned that CYC is a “mission driven organization” and “primarily a non-profit before a club” which stood out to me because my motives for joining the organization arise from my desire to help people. Giving back to the community is a substantial factor of my personal philosophy and I would be honored to be a part of an organization that felt the same way. ","I believe my experience with leadership, taking initiative, and problem solving aligns perfectly with your requirements. I have worked extensively with different companies as a food service worker. At both Starbucks and Smoothie King I have had shifts where I am left completely in charge of the store, being left with the tasks of cleaning, serving customers, preparing ingredients for later use, taking care of online orders, and answering calls by myself. To me, leadership means leading by example and I embodied this by prioritizing my tasks efficiently and focusing on the four pillars of self-leadership (purposefulness, mindfulness, reflection, and practice). The value that I can bring from this experience to CYC is a deep understanding of the day to day operations of restaurants as well as first-hand experience with leading a restaurant. I also have experience with taking initiative that will benefit my role as a Business Analyst. I understand that when working for CYC, you are working with real clients and students must be willing to take advantage of opportunities. Despite the COVID-19 challenges last semester, I have made an effort to help the community through an online therapy site called 7 cups. I will use this same strategy to reach out and find opportunities to help our clients like I did last semester despite any challenges or obstacles that we might come across. Lastly, my hard skills learned in my volunteer internship and NCSU classes have enhanced my problem solving skills and will aid me in my role within CYC. In BUS340 I have practiced problem solving through Excel, in BUS351 I have experience with Tableau, and in my internship I have practiced research to solve a problem/answer a question.

There is truly something rewarding about being able to explain topics to others in a way that is easy to comprehend and provides a solid foundation for them to build their knowledge in the future. The simple, ""thank you"" that I get after helping others is enough compensation for me. This passion has led me to become a tutor at NC State, and my hope is to start a career within financial services as a financial advisor or consultant. 

I believe that serving others is some of the most rewarding work, which is why I try to take every opportunity that allows me to carry this out. Not only would CYC allow me to have a direct positive impact on local businesses and nonprofits, it would also be an amazing hands on experience where I can develop useful consulting skills in a professional setting. Additionally, being able to work in a team of highly motivated and diverse NC State students who share a common passion for consulting and affecting change in the community would be an invaluable experience. ","Within a CYC engagement, I believe I would be able to bring strong problem solving and analytical skills to the table with a focus on taking initiative and maintaining a positive outlook through constant collaboration. Since I was a young kid, I have always been very inquisitive, as I remember constantly bugging my parents with all of my questions. Within consulting, I believe this is one of the most pivotal steps to obtain the information necessary and hone in on how to even start thinking about solving the problem. 

After asking a lot of questions, brainstorming, and coming up with a structured plan, it is also important to take initiative to implement the plan to see how effective it may be. During my time interning with Bosch Tool Corporation, this is something I had to do on a daily basis, as my supervisor gave me projects without much direction. So, I took the initiative to communicate with other engineers to obtain information I needed, and construct a forecasted analysis that I believed would be the most helpful data for him to improve efficiency within the plant. 

I really enjoy working in a team setting with other driven students, as it empowers me to be the best I can be for my team. I often find myself taking a supportive role within the team by ensuring everyone’s input is heard and facilitating a productive discussion by keeping our end goal in mind. CYC would be a great opportunity for me to showcase these skills and foster great relationships with students, businesses, and nonprofits.

We have been conditioned to think there are only certain paths to achieve this. As I continue my higher education, it has become increasingly evident that there are many ways to create positive impressions on those around us. The small business community has faced widespread devastation, the effects of which will be felt for years to come. I would like to be a part of an organization like CYC in order to work towards solutions for this vulnerable group. 
          Working on engagements and directly interacting with the local community is something that fulfills my desire to create change. Furthermore, the economic health of Raleigh is also directly related to the State ecosystem. The better Raleigh is doing, the stronger all of the sub-communities of Raleigh are, including the students and staff at NCSU. 
          Being involved with CYC would also give me the opportunity to network and work alongside students I would not traditionally have the ability to connect with. Collaborating with a diverse range of my peers to synthesize solutions will allow me to not only expand my knowledge, but also problem-solve alongside driven individuals. 
I am extremely passionate about creating change in the community, especially during such a tumultuous time. If given the opportunity to work within CYC on engagements, I would do my best to be an asset to my team and fulfill all my duties to the best of my ability. 
","          Experience is a commodity- invaluable and everlasting. Building my experience through this organization would give me the opportunity to develop my skills, and also make an impact in the surrounding community. While I hope to gain a versatile skill set from engagements, I would also like to apply the knowledge I have accumulated through both academic and extracurricular involvements. 
          This Spring my venture, Divided, is participating in the start-up accelerator Launch Chapel Hill. Working closely with professionals and UNC Kenan-Flagler professors to develop Divided has given me an unique perspective and network. Building out a web-application and identifying our market strategies, ect., has been an eye opening process. My familiarity with the entrepreneurial experience is something that would be an asset when interacting with future clients. 
          Additionally, my involvement in Alpha Kappa Psi, co-ed business fraternity, has exposed me to the value of brotherhood. A wide array of individuals collaborating to serve a common purpose is something that I highly regard. Similar to AKPsi, I believe the  CYC student network is a brotherhood that is able to come together to utilize individual strengths to overcome obstacles. I hope to apply the same values to any engagement I am a part of and seamlessly contribute to the organization as a whole. 
          My academic experience in CSC 216/217 has also equipped me with unique skills. My experience following meticulous project guidelines and identifying areas of weakness are skills that are useful in both technical and non-technical roles. 
          I hope to use my past experience as leverage to help CYC teams develop practical solutions. I am willing to learn from mistakes and commit myself to any tasks I take on. I truly believe, if given the opportunity, I can be an asset to Consult Your Community here at NC State.

Over the past few years, I have worked in a number of student teams, and I have grown immensely from them. Thus, I am always looking for more opportunities to work in groups. I am extremely excited to work, learn, and collaborate with CYC’s diverse and driven team of students.
Lastly, working towards benefiting women and minority business owners is something that will keep me extremely motivated and satisfied. 
","I have worked in the business team at Liquid Rocketry Lab for about a year now and have learned a lot -  from the recruitment process, interviewing new members to working on our fundraising model, and reaching out to various companies. Recently, I also started an online thrift store in order to provide consumers with sustainable alternatives. Through this store, I have learned about interacting with customers and making their experiences as easy as possible and also promoting one’s brand. I feel like these experiences combined with my willingness and drive to learn make me the perfect candidate for CYC.  Not only will I be applying my past experience, but I will always be willing to learn more and use that knowledge as time passes. 
Also, I have experience working in teams such as the ECE Ambassadors and the Student Conduct Board. Through these experiences, I have been equipped to communicate and work well with others.

Personally, CYC would help me in sharpening skills required to be a good candidate for post-graduate jobs, such as having a stronger sense of business acumen and the ability to think about a problem in terms of its entire system rather than in terms of one of its factions alone. Thinking within consulting frameworks seems to be a really fun challenge as well as a tool that can be widely applicable, no matter where I end up working.

Outside of improving upon my own abilities, I believe that consulting local Raleigh businesses and putting time and effort into the people behind them is an admirable and important job and I would be eager to participate for that reason alone. I love that this is a volunteer organization that provides a service that can be so dramatically beneficial for no cost at all.","I would bring a number of soft skills that I’ve developed by working in small groups in different environments. I am communicative, detail-oriented, and a fast learner. 

On my FEDD team freshman year, I advocated that we prioritize frequent communication and operate from an agreed-upon timeline in order to be efficient. When it came to our website, my attentiveness to project requirements and thorough explanation of our work gave us an edge over our competitors. As a team, we kept each other accountable in delivering our own work, while staying open to adjusting expectations and the timeline accordingly along the way and providing help when needed. This collaboration was crucial to our success.

The internship I completed last summer taught me how a certain level of independence is crucial on more corporate projects, and it required me to be adaptable. The software department consisted of only five other men, all of whom had more extensive coding experience than I did. I shadowed for only a short period of time before I was given assignments to do on my own. This required me to be more self-reliant and adaptive, but I also wasn’t afraid to ask for support when I needed it. 

In addition to my experience, I’d bring an eagerness to serve the community by listening and making sure the concerns of a client are heard and respected. Although this isn’t listed on my resume, over the past three months I’ve worked as a home health care provider to two different older women, one with cancer and one with a new hip replacement. While assisting these women, I have spoken to a lawyer about one woman’s will, I have been the chauffeur for medical appointments and vaccinations, I’ve cooked them meals and run errands. I pride myself in service, and I know how much people appreciate being taken care of while still taking charge of their own lives.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NcdivJnurvlpYLsDXEhV2euSp7pBgYDx,--,Lulu Holz,Strongly Recommend,Recommend,85,91,6,88,Interview,

However, I truly still want to be a part of CYC. A reason why I want to by in CYC is because I want to dive more into the consulting world. After deciding to not apply for medical school, I have been researching about consulting and I believe that it's a possible career option for me after college. Being a part of CYC will give me the opportunity to gain experience on consulting and to see if it's a good fit for me. 

Furthermore, I want to be a part of CYC because I am an advocate for small business/organizations. Ever since I move to the US, my family have had a small number of businesses for it was harder for my mom to find a well paying job as a Lao Immigrant.

I have always loved problem solving, and CYC would give me opportunities to solve business problems with fellow students and make a direct positive impact on small businesses in need. I am further motivated due to CYC’s goal to help underserved and under-resourced minority- and women-owned business, as they are less likely, historically, to have the access to capital that other businesses typically do. I am currently a chemical engineering major, but I am planning to add an economics double major this semester. I believe CYC is a perfect avenue to combine my passion for economics and business with my desire to serve my community. 

In addition to wanting to make an impact, I also hope to gain the valuable skills that one can learn in CYC. I am excited by the prospect of working in an interdisciplinary team. As an engineer, I think it is very important to have a broad perspective and working with business, humanities, and other science majors would be beneficial to developing my skills as a problem-solver. In addition to gaining problem-solving skills, I also hope to gain hard skills in data analysis, interviewing clients, and communication skills through presenting project findings to both my team and the business that we will work with. Furthermore, I wish to gain experience in the field of consulting, and I know that immersing myself in a client engagement is a great way to gain this first-hand. I was excited to hear that each team at CYC is even advised by a consultant from Deloitte, which makes me even more confident in the skills I will gain from being a member of CYC.","As a Park Scholar at NC State, this year I have been completing a Civic Engagement Initiative in the form of a Data Analysis Internship with Scivir, a 501(c)(3) non-profit that strives to provide air quality data to rural communities that normally lack proper particulate matter data or tracking. Through this project, I have become comfortable doing research to learn new things that are necessary to complete deliverables. I have performed data analysis in Python despite entering with zero experience, so I will be prepared for a CYC engagement where I may not initially know the right answer, but I have the skills to research it and find a solution, which I imagine will be imperative in a team of college students who certainly will not have all the answers.

I would also bring communication skills founded in a variety of experiences. As an organic chemistry teaching assistant at NC State, I have learned how to concisely but thoroughly explain complex concepts, which is vital for the presentations that my team would do in CYC engagements. I also have experience leading large groups of people through being a head swim coach, where I had to manage each swimmer’s best interests and the goals of the team at large. Communicating expectations and feedback to swimmers was a challenge at times, but it has prepared me for CYC. 

Additionally, I have a strong background in problem-solving that would be valuable to a CYC engagement. As an engineer, I have a strong foundation of problem-solving. I also have experience with creative thinking through a competitive problem-solving competition—Odyssey of the Mind—I did in high school. My team of six managed to win the 2018 World Championship.

I think that community outreach is so important and I have been looking for a way to find a volunteer opportunity that can grow my abilities and also help both in the present as well as protect the longevity of a community. An opportunity like this allows me to simultaneously build a foundation for my career and be able to learn things that I don’t think could be learned in a corporate setting. Things that I can use and bring to large firms in the future and try and create as much positive change as possible. 
I feel especially passionate about CYC focusing on helping small businesses owned by women and persons of color. Focusing on marginalized groups and their small businesses helps to bring such a rich culture and a wonderful ripple effect that would help other small businesses get established. I think it is a very underserved community that leads to endless frustration in trying to seek help. It would be amazing to be a part of the group trying to help and better the community and the lives of so many just trying to fully realize their passions.
Finally I want to take advantage of the national outreach CYC has to help businesses in between the majority cities, as rural communities also have small businesses that need help, as well as help grow the club in any way I can as a national presence as I think it has an amazing mission that can be used nationwide.
","I think that I can bring a lot of value to an engagement. My current employer hired me to improve our output and the process overall in order to create a proposal that could gain more funding. While this is a slow process, I believe we have created something of value that I can be proud of. I will also be working at Cummins this summer and while that does not help in this semester, I think that it’ll help me bring real big business ideas to the table and understand the practical side of creating solutions in the field in what works and what does not. 
I also believe that my major has prepared me for consulting and given me valuable skills to be able to help real businesses. I have learned to find ways to reorganize businesses and create efficiencies where possible. My classes and projects have revolved around an enormous amount of problem solving, and I feel I have really grown into the role. Also, if the company were to have a physical product, I have learned about product development, marketing, and manufacturing on a large and small scale which can help small businesses to scale up and not fall behind, thus improving their productivity and customer satisfaction. 
My experiences in extracurriculars have also helped to create a strong sense of teamwork in all of my work. I have learned and become capable of working both individually and in a group on a team based project.

I found it intriguing to learn about small businesses and their owners, particularly those in the nearby Triangle area. More recently, as I practiced cases for CYC and my EY summer internship interview, I found the experience to be more enjoyable and engaging than I had expected. Lastly, CYC seems to be one of the very few, if not, the only student organization that can continue to make a difference virtually for businesses in need during such a difficult time.

I was initially hesitant to apply this semester for reasons I will outline in the extra information section, but I would still very much like an opportunity to join CYC and aid in the meaningful work you do.","During my research last summer, I was initially tasked with recruiting small businesses and entrepreneurs to join the study. However, I noticed a few issues in several areas of the study, so I offered some suggestions to potentially remedy the lack of upfront participation and to offer more actionable advice to its participants following the study.

I have been given an exceptional and inclusive learning environment by the community and the university in my time here and I see the opportunity to make a real-world contribution to a small business as an undergraduate as unique and invaluable. Additionally, I am excited by the opportunity to connect with other young, motivated professionals. I find this opportunity even more special during the pandemic where moments that breed collaboration and interpersonal connection have been so fleeting. I look forward to the prospect of working on a diverse team with members from varying backgrounds that provide exposure to new frames of mind, new industries, and areas of specialization that are all equally important in our society and the working world. I believe that facilitating economic growth in a consulting position is as much of a service that one can do for any business or community; the feeling and fulfillment of seeing my work turn in to satisfied customers, healthy communities, and thriving business owners is one that I am willing to work diligently to achieve. ","I see myself bringing critical thinking, conscientiousness, and strong communication skills to a CYC engagement. Maintaining conscientiousness to me, means preserving the integrity of my word regarding commitments, to the team and clients, as well as being aware of other people’s perspectives and opinions. An important part of an effective team and especially in a consulting role is patient and active listening with clients and amongst one another in the team. In addition to conscientiousness and active listening I see myself bringing strong presentation and speaking skills to engagements and CYC meetings. 
Regarding technical skills, I am proficient in Microsoft PowerPoint and have experience in financial modeling using Microsoft Excel. Additionally, I have experience configuring and displaying data using SQL, Microsoft Power BI, and Tableau which I have found extremely helpful when presenting data to company executives.

My mother owned a dance studio for most of my life, so I have seen and understand the challenges that small business owners face first hand. She loved teaching and impacting the lives of the students who came through her studio, but ultimately had to close down her business because she needed to spend more time as a single mother. In high school I worked for a locally owned boutique and helped start a non-profit that helps organize and fund student engineering teams in my community. These experiences shaped me to be I am who I am today and I know there are many small businesses and non-profits within the Raleigh area that are making a huge impact throughout the community. I know running a small business is difficult and I would love to help alleviate some of the stress that owners are under by helping solve their problems. I am not from the Raleigh area, but I have loved my time living here during my college years and hope to stay local to the Triangle area after I graduate.

I find your work impressive, inspiring and  meaningful. When I talk with my friends or acquaintances about my Business Administration major, they often tell me that business and management is only about making money. I don’t agree with that opinion because I believe that businesses and management can and should have a positive impact on society, the environment and the economy. CYC is an example of how students can use their knowledge and experience to help small businesses and nonprofits. I would like to be a part of that amazing team and contribute to the meaningful and influential work you are doing. 

Your focus on women and minority business owners, aligns with my beliefs that in an often men-dominated business world, women and minority business owners should be supported in a special way and given equal chances to success. Seeing how my close friends in Germany started their own social business (https://en.reframe-rt.de), made me realize that a young and small start-up can often have an amazing business idea, but without support and funding the idea could fail. In my opinion, CYC and your diverse team provide extremely valuable support to the businesses you consult while promoting a greater good. Sometimes just an extra set of eyes can bring a new perspective to a challenge or an idea, in my opinion. I believe that I can be a valuable asset to your team and I would love to bring in my passion, motivation and dedication to your team. ","Volunteering has always been an important part of my life. After high school I volunteered at a day care center in Tel Aviv. I was working hands-on with colleagues from many different ethnic and religious backgrounds. This service taught me how important sharp communication is and how difficult it can be when you do not speak the same language or have different socio-cultural backgrounds. I am proud of this experience and I believe that I can apply what I have learned about communication and diversity during this service in a CYC engagement. 

My six-month internship at ING bank helped me to improve my analytical and communication skills. The daily tasks required thorough and detailed analyzation of loan agreements and contractual changes which has greatly improved my attention to detail. Furthermore, daily communication with global clients via email or phone has contributed to refine my communication skills. The challenges that I tackled throughout my internship taught me to be proactive and leave my comfort zone. My team appreciated me not only for my ability to learn quickly, they also valued my interpersonal skills. I hope to transfer the skills and competence  that I have gained and improved to an exciting CYC engagement with your team. 

Throughout my first year of undergraduate studies in Germany I have participated as a delegate at National Model United Nations in New York. Hearing, discussing, and giving speeches on different ideas and possible solutions at the conference in the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees committee has improved my ability to think quickly and critically and interact fruitfully with other participants on various levels.

Lately, I have been getting really invested in my business degree, but I am always leaning towards some sort of consulting career, whether that is in the business field or more towards environmental science. No matter which way I go, I definitely need to work on gaining skills in consulting! 

I especially love that CYC works with local businesses and especially women- and minority-owned organizations. Due to COVID-19, small businesses have been really struggling and are not getting the help they need from our federal government to keep running! I am so worried that  our local business owners won't be able to make it through this trying time, and if I can be a valuable asset to them for no cost, I would love to do that.

However, I also see these times as an opportunity for new business ideas! The reality is that the world is going through an intense metamorphosis right now, and when we come out on the other side, EVERYTHING will be different. This has led to technology based companies going through a massive boom right now, and because businesses will be more willing to operate remotely, even beyond the pandemic, there will definitely be product and service ideas that will help make that transition easier. I would love to be a part of that metamorphosis. 

I would be tremendously proud to aid these companies that are battling through the pandemic, but also I think this would be an amazing opportunity to learn exactly HOW companies are able to do so incase we ever go through something like this again!","I am studying Business Administration with a concentration in Human Resources. A big part of human resources is recruitment, development, and planning! It is so much more than just being a ""people person."" In HR, you are the link between managers and employees, but also have the opportunity to analyze the structure of a company and all of it's moving parts in order to understand what can be improved.

Last semester, I took my first HR Class, MIE330. In this class, I learned all about the planning and structuring of a business. In that class, I developed a very basic understanding of the most popular HR ideas like different methods of recruitment, pay structure, performance management, interviewing techniques, training, etc. I think this will be great contribution to CYC because I have a solid base in all different areas of HR.

This semester, I am taking one of my HR concentration courses called HR Analytics (MIE437). I never knew anything about HR Analytics because it is a slow growing field, but it can make a HUGE difference in a business. In my analytics class, I have quickly learned how to use Excel to analyze and define different issues. We currently are doing a project on employee engagement, where we have a spreadsheet of a hypothetical sample of 130 employees, some demographic information, and their answers to an engagement survey (scale of 1-5) asking about effective commitment, social integration, engagement, and burnout. Using this data from the survey, we were able to answer the question regarding employee sense of belonging by taking all the measures of central tendency and variance in order to make a conclusion about employee sense of belonging, which enabled us to figure out what needs to be fixed about this hypothetical organization.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Dn6bJadKdWebCSIlRBRgvknbRUQxW_85,--,--,--,--,0,0,0,0,Reject,Declined interview

I have participated in Alternative Service Breaks, volunteered at the local animal shelter, and tutored children from impoverished areas. Knowing that service is a vital part of my character, I have searched for an organization that I can make a powerful impact with, and I strongly believe that Consult Your Community (CYC) is that organization.

CYC’s focus on serving under-resourced women and minority-owned businesses and nonprofits is the main reason I want to join this organization. Those establishments  are the main reason that my time in Raleigh has truly felt like home. I also really admire CYC’s commitment to making lifelong connections with students from diverse backgrounds, alumni, and industry leaders and would truly love to be a part of CYC’s close knit community. Hearing about the connections and impacts CYC’s members have made on the Raleigh community has really convinced me that I too can make a positive difference in the community that has helped raise me these past four years.
","I believe that I am a great fit for CYC because its mission to empower under-resourced women and minority-owned small businesses and nonprofits fits with my personal mission of making a positive impact on the world by lifting up underprivileged communities using economic policy. In my Econometrics research project, I specifically studied how empowering women through education and knowledge is linked to positive growth in a country’s GDP by analyzing data from United Nations annual reports. In my Industrial Organization class, I presented on the decision making model of a small business during the pandemic, specifically craft breweries. I gained an understanding of this thought process by speaking to the owners of local Raleigh breweries, like Crank Arm Brewing company and Trophy Brewing.

Another value I share with CYC’s mission is its focus on teamwork. Throughout my school and work experience, collaboration has been my most used and valued skill. From things like helping a classmate study for a physics test to putting together a presentation about RTI’s carbon capture technology, my teamwork and leadership skills are sharpened daily and will continue to through my work at CYC. 

Most importantly, I am very passionate about problem-solving for under-resourced businesses and nonprofits in the Raleigh area and would love the opportunity to do so through the CYC organization.

In the village class, I learned about the importance of product-market fit and how to find it. Although I have truly enjoyed my time learning about entrepreneurship, I feel like I am not learning as much as I would like to know about running a business or how founders actually overcome obstacles. I feel my entrepreneurial education thus far only covers starting a company or building a product and completely omits how to run that company once started. I want to join Consult Your Community because I want to gain hands on experience about running a business. All in all, one of my big educational goals for the second half of my college career is to gain more hands-on soft skills and experience about the business world.

I have always known that I wanted a future in creation. While studying graphic communications, I began working for the industrial and systems engineering department at NC State in their creative services department. One of our projects consisted of redesigning the departmental website to improve its accessibility over the course of four weeks. 

Through this project I learned how website accessibility dramatically changes and improves a low-vision user's experience, and redesigning the website showed me the importance of designing for all users. This project also taught me how a group of people can make a huge change to an organization, vastly improving users experience. Everyone deserves to have a quality experience with the products they use. We did not design a website for those with low vision but rather improved an existing product, helping our department become more accessible. While I did want a future in creation, at this point I realized I wanted to participate in something that valued problem solving and helping others as well. Because Consult Your Community holds the same values, I am excited at the possibility to follow my passions through this organization.  ","While studying graphic communications, I began working for the industrial and systems engineering (ISE) department at NC State in their creative services department. I learned how to design and solve problems and applied these skills immediately in the department. I gained a wide set of skills from an interesting assortment of experiences. I know how to layout magazines, create technical drawings, and plan large events like NC State's Shackathon, a yearly fundraiser for Habitat for Humanity. I also completed numerous projects that solved problems and helped people improve their lives, tackling issues like redesigning a vertical garden for those suffering from reduced farmlands and improving the speed and safety of a snow sled. 

I gained invaluable experience while participating in the Rochester's Institute of Technology's Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU). During this REU, I led a research project on communication competency in physics classrooms and STEM industries. Communication competency, how well an individual communicates within their field, was low in many places, and we suggested best practices to implement that would improve competency in various departments. I developed skills in gathering data, analyzing data, and designing a solution for a specific problem. These skills enhanced my understanding of research structure and design principles and offered a deeper understanding of how to find solutions. 

My minors in industrial engineering and sociology also provide me with a deeper understanding of how products affect different environments and users.

I feel that the opportunity for communication skills development, real-business interaction, and most importantly the community impact sets CYC apart from most student organizations, which would not only provide me with a quality exposure to business consulting experience but help me support my community. Another large reason for why I feel called to join CYC is the support that I could provide for local entrepreneurs for no cost, which will help booster not only my own professional skills but theirs as well. Even though I am an engineering major, I want to develop my business communication skills and understanding of management and entrepreneurship, so an organization such as CYC can not only help me in my own academic and personal interests but also let me use my time and young mind to help real people in the area that need help.

It’s because as a minority, I feel a strong desire to help disadvantaged communities gain an equal economic footing, and what better way is there to achieve such a goal other than starting a business? I would see it as an honor, and my duty, to help them however I can. After hearing that they are businesses right in my own neighborhood too, and I could not be more compelled to help them.
I’m aware of the struggles of starting a business. My uncle used to own a pizza shop in Alaska where he had to fully commit to it alongside his wife and daughters. It was simultaneously both one of the most rewarding and draining experiences, he told me. Eventually, the man who sold the shop to him before came back and opened a competing restaurant and he was basically forced to sell it back to the man. 
Although my uncle and his family are doing well, other minorities may not get off as lucky. It’s because they likely lack the resources that others don’t, such as enough capital to start. Even if they do get off the ground, they are succumbed to larger, more established, generally white businesses that can out-compete their small start-up.  
This is why I think it’s so important to help local minority/women owned businesses and why I want to join CYC. To be there for people who need it so they can reap the sweet fruits that owning a business reaps and possibly begin generational wealth in their family.
","I’m a Ben Franklin Scholar, through my multi-disciplinary education, I’m well suited for the diverse teams I’ll be a part of. On such teams especially, you need to make sure everyone is included and doing what they do best.
	For example, I used to be a barista at Dunkin Donuts. I worked with people of all ages, backgrounds, genders, and cultures. We were usually busy, but I remember one day we were particularly swamped, with a drive-thru time in the 400s (supposed to be ~200) and my manager was busy in their office with paperwork. Seeing the desperate situation, I stepped up and started organizing and delegating responsibilities to my coworkers shiftmates. Saying who will stay on drinks, sandwiches, front counter, and so on making the judgments off of who did what best. From then on, we started to push the drive-thru time down, and by the time our manager came back the time was back to normal.
	In chess, there are always multiple options you can take, you need to select a few to examine and then choose the best one. I think consulting a business requires the same mindset. When I’m playing I have to keep in mind all of the pieces, forgetting one can lead to disaster. In CYC, where you’re dealing with people’s livelihoods you have to keep the same attention to detail. When playing I also remember to stay positive, you’re bound to have some low moments but it’s how you respond to those moments that determine the type of player you are. Consulting your community works the same way.
