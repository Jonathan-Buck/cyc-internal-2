Explain your answer to the previous question.,,,Sophie had very detailed examples of demonstrated leadership and community service that were very impressive and made it clear that she enjoys doing work that combines her skills and interests with community service. She also showed an understanding of the challenges non-profits face and spoke with clarity and confidence.,"LOVED. This woman shows high drive, care for her community, curiosity, empathy, and problem solving skills. Knows how to leverage her skills to hel her community and had FANTASTIC examples as a freshman. Was not the most concise in communication but I love her so I am fine with it","While not all of Jannah's answers were very clear, it was very evident that she has a care for her community and has experience working in teams and business settings to achieve a common goal. I got the impression that when she puts her mind to something, she can excel in that endeavor and would be a good addition to an engagement team. I was borderline Recommend with Hesitation.","Candidate did not have clear or concise communication. Does have care for her community, but I would have hoped she could speak to her experiences better as a Junior. She had a few answers that were solid, a few that were not very substantive. Does have good volunteer experience, not many hard skills (but does have epic knowledge which is cool), and should be able to concisely explain. She seemed to be a titch nervous","See miscellaneous notes section on the other sheet, sent thank you email",Applicant demonstated a strong desire to help others through service and I feel she would be a good addition to CYC.,"Disha is a very strong candidate. She was very prepared for this interview and spoke eloquently and in a very professional manner. Her high school involvements were centered around a common theme of diversity, equity, and inclusion and she was able to speak well to her experiences and how they have helped her. We we're able to touch much on her perspective about small businesses or why she thinks CYC is important in helping them, but I think that might be the fault of our questions and not her. She did tie her DEI work to why she wants to join CYC, alluding to helping women and minority owned businesses. I think she would be a wonderful addition to CYC.",Applicant was very wellspoken and had very detailed and targeted answers to every question. She also displayed a confidence in her answers and herself. She was very invloved in her community in highschool and participated in facilitating creative solutions to several problems within her school community.,Ruikang has a strong academic background and work experience related to problems facing local businesses. ,"Ruikang is a definitely a team player with humility. He doesn't have much experience in leadership but he had good values about what it means to be a leader and what it means to be part of a team. I think him being an international student might explain why he hasn't been as involved in his community as other applicants, but since coming to NC he has been a helpful neighbor and volunteered his time to help his neighbor's daughter learn Chinese. I don't think we'll have an issue with him thinking he is above others as a Master's student like we might with some other Master's applicants. And while he didn't speak much on community, I think he is eager to help others and has the right heart for CYC, even if he doesn't have the business accuem or understanding of problems yet.","Sophia seems like a very well-qualified applicant, however I am not sure how well she will work on an engagement team. While she is a clear communicator and clearly a hard worker, she cited having difficulty resolving conflict in teams. I recommend she advance because she seems like she would be a great addition to CYC if she works collaboratively in a case interview. I also felt like it was worth noting she took the interview in a hoodie outside.",Good communication and interview skills. Had a good grasp on why she wanted to join CYC and why CYC is important in the community. Felt that she will be willing to put in the work for CYC and will have a positive impact,Jacob's experiences in college and high school very clearly align with the mission and values of CYC. His academic experiences and skillset sound like they have great promise for CYC engagements.,Seemed very passionate about helping the Raleigh.,"Her answers were fast and shallow. She blitzed through the first 3 questions in 3 minutes. She showed up 2 minutes late. Could not provide tangible hard skills. I'd only want to see her case in order to determine whether or not she can add any value to our organization. Overall, I'm not impressed.","Had good other involvemnt at school. But interview was lackluster. Not great responses, seemed to not have a great grasp on what CYC does in engagements and what she could add to the team. Only referenced her coursework as an area to help",She seems genuinely interested in helping the community and bringing positive change. Also brings a unique perspective and skillset as a stem major.,"She seems smart and like she has a lot of potential. Interested in healthcare consulting, and her academic background is definitely unique for CYC. ",She brings a lot of leadership experience and working with a team for dance which is vital for cyc. Wants to learn,"Awesome candidate. She's a freshman, but an absolute rockstar. Involved academically and in extra cirriculars. Understands weaknesses and has ways to work around them. She did an excellent job giving answers and providing information about herself. She's probably gonna end up in leadership","He has a lot of industry experience, he cares about the community, and he seems to be a good leader. ",Came across very smart and has experience in consulting. Would add a ton of value to any engagement he would work on. Seemde like he would be a great leadeer in CYC. Didn't mention small businesses as much as would have liked but overall very good. ,She definitely has a lot of experiences that can be beneficial to CYC as an organization. Her demonstrated interest in consulting as a whole is definitely a plus.,"She has a lot of experience, and a willingness to make a difference in our community!","Shreeya seems enthusiastic about the organization and what the organization entails, but seemed to struggle a little with conveying her thoughts clearly. She also seems to have an interest in learning more about what CYC is and is service-minded.",Shreeya demonstrated strong engagment in her community and on campus organizations at UNCC with time spent in leadership roles within those organizations. While she has demonstrated passion I found her answers and communication lacked depth and it was a challenge to get her to expand on her experiences and thoughts on the interview questions.,Her background and experiences seem perfect for CYC. I don't think we have that many Mech E majors and she definitely has that firsthand experience with her parents owning a small business and her dad being an IT consultant and she aced the questions about what she can add as value to the organization and what CYC would provide for small businesses. ,"Has a really good understanding about CYC and what it does, as well as the passion to help others using her technical expertise.",He seems professional and shows a desire to help out the local community and learn about business needs.,"Chinmay was an average candidate, he was not impressive. I don't think he does a good job of marketing himself. The professionalism and business accumen is there but the passion for community and leadership strength is not, at least through his answers. He kept his answers short and didn't have good examples for them (even though he had plenty of material to work with on his resume AND he's a Park). We had to each ask 2 additional questions to probe for more. He seems adept with the business and procedural part of CYC, especially when you look at his application, but any community passion he does have didn't come across. I would recommend with hesitation because it would be helpful to see him in a team setting but I'm not sure the case interview will alleviate my concerns.  ",He seems very ambitious and driven. His passion for many different things is exemplified by his accomplishments. I would think he's a good fit for CYC but he seems a little over-ambitious so I'm not sure how he'd adjust to CYC's needs if what he needs to work on isn't directly related to his interests.,"Has a lot of ambition, seems more interested in CYC for advancing his career vs CYC mission. Has a lot of experience, super passionate about buisness. I tried to narrow down what he was interested in the most  but he just named all facets of buisness.",She seems to have a good perception of the needs of small businesses and had an anecdote about how she's contributed in the past with the internship she worked with.,"Overall, I thought her answers were pretty substantive and she demonstrates prior experience in dealing with a lot of the issues CYC faces. Very personable and able to clearly communicate her thoughts. I think she'd be an asset to the team.","Smart dude. Had good answers and related them to why it matters for CYC. I'm worried about his ability to work on a team. Being that he's so smart, I don't know how he'll deal with people less technical or less intelligent then him. I think these questions can be answered in a case interview.",Suchir is a very impressive candidate with a wide range of experiences and leadership. He communicated his thoughts and ideas very well. In one of the questions he took a lot of ownership/credit over a project that sounded like a team effort and his description made the project seem like he was teaching his teammate rather than working with him. He did hedge this at the end saying he learned stuff from his teammate too but it rubbed me the wrong way (this is a very minor criticism).,"He's very smart and has leadership abilities. There was a bit of a language barrier, but overall, he wasn't a terrible communicator. Something that concerns me is his investment into the community and also his time availability. He seemed very kind and would probably do well in a case, but it may come down to our space for a case and whether we want a 5 year grad student getting a PhD.","Junchen was intelligent, thoughtful and humble. I appriciated him talking about his experience in his lab and the role the NC state community has played in his life as an international student. However, his answers were a bit long winded and he didn't demonstrate a great understanding of how our work could help local businesses, though the former isn't a knock and understanding also comes form working with CYC a bit. Concerned about his free time.",No show,No show,"Her interview was a little bit rough-- very short answers, she was breaking up throughout because of poor connection (don't think she can really be faulted for that though, she said they were doing dorm inspections). She did not have great examples but I think part of that comes from being a freshman and having such a different background from most -- lived in so many different places and countries -- so that may be a barrier to her having experiences to pull on for these questions. What I liked most about her is that she seems excited about CYC and would give a lot of effort to the organization","Giavanna seems ready and willing to jump with both feet into volunteering and commiting her time to CYC, but she also seems a little naive/unfamiliar with what the work entails. Her examples were a bit repetitive and not as community-oriented as I would've liked to see, but since she's travelled a lot it seems like she hasn't had time to ground herself in one place like most solid candidates would.","She just missed a strongly recommend from me because she hasn't had a ton of community involvement since high school. however, her corporate experience rocks, and her answer to the hillsborough street question was one of the best I've heard.  ","Meredith is an amazing candidate, she wowed me with her responses and exemplifies all the qualities we look for in a candidiate. She understands what CYC does and small business needs very well! I think she also has great leadership skills. She covered all the areas even if the question didn't directly ask it which shows she knows what we look for and what it means to be in CYC.","I wish she elaborated on her answers but seems like a unique applicatn with great experiences, small business oriented","Lindsey could be a good addition to the team, given her status as a non-traditional student with work experience in multiple industries, I think she could provide valuable insight to the team. She didn't show much care for the community through her answers or touch on what issues small businesses need though. Her application responses gave vague stuff about community and her personal small business experience could combat small business needs. ","Chloe is a nice girl who seems passionate about joining CYC and contributing. I think she lacks knowledge of small business problems as she just briefly touched on student's perspectives adding value. I think her heart is in the right place and a case would help us understand if she has what it takes to contribute to an engagement environment. She could have elaborated more in her answers, they felt like general explanations of issues and not like a walkthorough of the process and the result with how her involvement impacted the result.","This candidate has great academic acheivement, is well spoken and clearly focused, but did not necessary check the boxes for humility and focus on diversity. I think she would do well, but there is better candidates out there in my opinion.","She seems passionate about the community, but she didn't seem like a leader and struggled to answer two of the three required questions. ","Gloria seemed nervous for the interview and did not give the most discriptive answers, but she had great professional communication and seemed like she would really dive into CYC. I would say great candidate overall. In my opinion, she is worth another chance to present her business acumen in the case interview. I think her performance there should dictate her result.","Very well spoken, got to see a little bit of everything service, professional, academic, she showed passion, and her story about how she turned around the family business was great, asked follow up questions that i always ask in interviews and was dressed professionally","Dylan was very knowledgable and extremely well spoken. She maybe didn't have the most humility, but overall I would say she would make a great contribution to CYC. Definitely has potential for a leadership role and has a lot of good things coming to her in the future.","Was great to speak with, always positive and ethusiastic, had great internship and study abroad experiences and provided specific examples for the questions we asked that highlighted her strenghts, would like to see in case interview to see if she has business knowledge that can be aplied",Has had a wide variety of experiences which would contribute to any project. Seemed interested in getting more involved in the community,"Chill dude, perosnable, had good experiences, would like to see some more leadership abilities and business acumen, definetly has a lot of marketing experience with is a plus, sent thank you email","Chill guy enjoyed speaking with him. His internship experience is a positive, but seemed to lack in good answers for community and an understanding of what CYC does. ",He has been very involved in the community and has done a lot of unique activities to stay involved; I think he would be an asset the CYC because he demonstrates strong leadership characteristics ,"Sean appears like he would bring a multi-facited approach to CYC and could contribute a lot. He is a smart guy, and has a lot of good life experiences that could help him in our engagements. ",She is so involved and has made large contributions to every organization she has been involved in. I think she would be a great member of CYC and thrive in the organization. Her dad owns a small business so she understands the general struggles that businesses go through. ,"The applicant demonstates a care for her community, and gave great answers, however the answers to the main questions seemed to be a bit vague and not specific towards the question.",Hes had a variety of leadership and service experience and exhibits good passion for cyc,"This applicant had very detailed a specific examples of scenarios for each question, was very well sopken, and clearly demonstates a desire to help others and service his community. He was a very impressive porfolio of community service. ",He has a care about learning about consulting but was not that good at clearly communicate and did not really demonstrate a passion for the community,"Zahid is incredibly well-spoken, hard working, and driven, and would be a valuable asset to CYC. ","Asked gret questions in the end and was an active listener during the interview, understands CYC importance and business needs but would like to see more service oriented, related first gen student struggle and operating a small business, mid otherwise",She is very inquisitive and asked a lot of meaningful questions. She doesn't seem the most impressive in terms of personal accolades but definitely shows the most potential to grow in terms of how interested she is in learning.,,,"Easy Recommend. Peter seems very self-aware and a great communicator as a freshman. While his examples did not go as deep into detail as I would have liked, it is clear that he has a care for his community, a drive and capability for leadership, and good character.",I'm not sure how interested he is in the mission of CYC. I do believe he is a very nice kid and would work well in a team.,"I believe he is a good candidate, but his outward display of passion towards CYC's mission wasn't incredibly evident. ","He is very well spoken and shows that he has ample team experiences which he can draw from that can help him in CYC. A lot of his exmaples highlight that he is very passionate about the work that he does, and in my opinion, would be a great fit for CYC.",n/a,no show,He seems like a really solid candidate who cares about the community. I would love to see how he performs in the case. ,"I felt that Shubham had great experience historically and did a great job communicating those experiences with us. Also, he seemed to have a genuine interest/passion in the work that CYC does and in the process of finding and workigng with businesses.",She's a very good candidate and I would be excited to see how see performs in the case.,I felt that the candidate had great experiences that were related to the questions we were asking and they also had a clear interest and desire to work on business topics and with local businesses despite being a computer science major.,I think she is a great candidate. I would love to see how she does in the case. ,"First of all, ask her about 11th grade. Absolutely crazy story that her school literally shut down and they had to teach themselves. Also though, great communication and very eloquent. Very personable as well and has a clear desire to help the community. I think she hasn't had experience working with local businesses necessarily but that is more of a thing she can learn than a downside or drawback ","well articulated, wouldn't think she was an international student, a lot of service oriented and impressive projects she has initiated, leadership abilities, would be a great addition to cyc, can see she has good critical thinking but would like to see more during case, always smiling and positive","Divya seemed very capable of leaderhsip roles and opporutnies as well as being interested in helping the community and solving issues that plague those around her. The only piece that I would say to be aware of is that she spoke a lot about her leadership skills and experiences and not so much about her ability to work within a team or even under others. It's great to see leaderhsip interest, but that also comes with being able to listen and take in feedback from those with more time/experience etc.  ","great district c experinece, humble, always smiling and positive, lot of leadership skills, ","I think she would be a great candidate, my only holdup/thought is that she is a freshman and definitely seemed a little nervous in her interview. Honestly, I don't view this as an issue and I think she could benefit from CYC and leadership/confidence opportunities, but also if there are a bunch of other candidates, she could apply next semester theoretically. ",There was s slight language barrier so his answers were not as in depth/choppy but he took time to fully understand the questions and provide a response. he had some good examples and can work well with a team,"Hasheem seemed like a very friendly guy, language barrier seemed to be an issue for him to verbalize his thoughts, diverse background only 4 years in the US, wasn't able to provide many examples of leadership intiaitve or project teams that were succesful, communication was ","pluses: had good motivations, understood our mission pretty well, comes from entrepreneurial background. minuses: guy was a tad informal considering this is a behavioral interview, answers were long winded and not the most concise, some questions weren't really answered, am not sold on the teamwork aspect. also said networking was a skill he could help bring small businesses- don't know if this is a unique or a bad answer. ",This guy seemed very intentional and passionate about wanting to join CYC. Through the stories he has shared it was clear to see the reasons of why he would want to join. Everything came across very genuine.,Bryant was a little vague and unclear in his experiences and answers to the interview questions. He seemed to be a little more interested after I talked about my favorite part of CYC but he came across very monotone. He asked for a minute after each question and it was hard to follow his answer framework. I think he is a nice person who is capable of contributing to CYC but his interview was not the best. ,I'd be interested to see how he does in a case interview. ,No show,no show,I think that Tia demonstrated care for her community and could be a good potential canidate for CYC. Her answers were very short and sometimes it was hard to see the detail behind her words. She kept asking to repeat the question to clarify if she answered it correctly but did not really change any of her answers. I think she understands the impact CYC has but her interview could have been better.,She seemed like phenomenal leader. She is involved in a large advocacy organization is working to help food insecurity through financial policy and analytics. She appears to have the right skills that would make her a good fit for CYC. She also appears to be a pretty adept leader.,Aishwarya seemed very enthusiastic about joining CYC and came across as a good potential canidate. Her interview answers were very long-winded and did not fully address what was being asked. It also seemed like she was more interested in joining CYC for consulting or career purposes rather than helping the community. I would still reccomend her solely for her enthusiasm to join but I would like to see how she does in the case interview.,"I really liked her as an applicant and I think she did pretty well in the interview. She talked a lot though. Like a lot a lot. Which I'm sure wouldn't be an issue in conversation, but in an interview where I'm trying to find the value in the story it can be a little challenging to pay attention. Other than that though she seemed wonderful!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
