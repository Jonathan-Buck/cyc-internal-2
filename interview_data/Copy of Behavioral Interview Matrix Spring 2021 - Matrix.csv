Explain your answer to the previous question.,,,"Lital seems really sweet. I thought she was an ok interviewer...her answers didn't really blow me away. But she is also new to the US, and I think she probably underplayed some of her experiences. She definitely has a strong care for her community, and I think she would really work well in one of our teams.",Seems awesome; really genuine and kind. She connected with Toni Kalusche before the interview. I think she will provide a great unique perspective to CYC and she is very mission-driven. I am not strongly recommending though because I feel like she didn't do a great job highlighting her individual strengths and contributions in high-impact experiences (and am not sure about exactly how valuable she will be on an engagement). But I think there is a lot of potential and I would love to work with her.,"No question. Everything is pretty much perfect except she rambles a ton. She would be extermely valuable on a team though, seems like she would go above and beyond to improve CYC, and has a very acute understanding of how CYC can help the community.",Candidate demonstrates clear mission-driven passion. She is incredibly well-rounded and organized. ,"I thought she was a good applicant. She didn't blow me away, but I felt that she was thoughtful and genuine. Clearly also smart, and I think she could bring a lot of technical skills to the table. I didn't see her as someone who has done as much teamwork/leadership as I would like to see out of a junior, which was my complaint. But I still think she'd be a great addition, and I could see her becoming an EM in her final semester.","She has really solid experience and has a good understanding of teamwork from the business analytics program, which is something that seems really similar to CYC 's engagements.  Could explain teamowrk/leadership. Well thought-out answers, could deifnitely see her doing well in the case.","Isra was ok, but she didn't have a lot of experiences that she talked about which I thought would translate well to CYC. I liked her as a person, but she seemed very nervous. So it was hard to tell if she just didn't have great experiences or if that was just the nerves. She talked a lot about diversity, which I liked. And I thought she would be a good member in CYC, but I expect a little more out of someone who's a second semester sophomore. DIdn't really seem to have any quality teamwork/leadership situations that she's been in.","I want to recommend her; she was a bit on the reserved side in terms of talking about her abilities and experience, but I do think we could potentially help her grow. Didn't have much experience applicable to CYC, but she was self-aware and open, which I liked. Was clearly nervous and that could have affected the way she communicated as well.","Again, she's gotten better. Not much to say here -- loved it and I want her through. Only downside was she spoke mostly about high school but I put her back on track.",10/10 candidate. Best person I've ever interviewed for CYC.,Super cool guy. I loved his personality and humility and think he would be a great representative of CYC. I have some doubts though about his ability to contribute well to an engagement. He displayed a below average understanding of the challenges that small businesses face and neglected to mention that we try and work with businesses that need the most help (women-owned/minority-owned often). I think there is a decent amount missing here but I could also imagine him becoming a really good member so I recommend with hesitation.,"strong leadership qualities, recognizes the benefit of diversity in group settings, community involved and advocate for helping, seems like a dominate personality that maybe struggles with letting others lead, did not give specifics about what CYC does that suggests understanding of our impact outside of ""new perspectives"" on problems","Well spoken and presented self well, understands struggles of starting business/organization. Has a good understanding of the needsfor team diversity","This was close to a do not recommend for me. I actually liked him a lot but I have serious hesitations about his ability to work with diverse teams and his lacking understanding of how our mission addresses the challenges of small businesses. He seems really smart -- if the competition is stiff, I would probably suggest he re-apply","She struggled with communicating some of her ideas. Graduating next semester. Very clearly demonstrated teamwork and abilities, but used RTI as an example for every quesiton. I think she is qualified, but I am not sure she would make a huge impact in 1 semester. Content of interview seemed on the level of underclassmen with less experience, not senior with mulitple professional experiences.","Clear communication, clearly has technical skills and lots of experinece, has worked on several teams in the past, seemed like she didn't know much about what CYC does or what small businesses are. Used same exmaple every time.","Really liked his personality, communicated very clearly and concisely, demonstrated that he knows how a team works and a lot about small businesses and CYC mission. Did not have a great answer for an example where he was a leader. Seemed put together.","I liked him a lot. He was very charismatic and seemed eager about the work that CYC does. His dad runs a small business so he seems to fully understand the plights of a small business, especially during this pandemic. He was very put together and easy to talk to. He was to be a consultant in his future. Did not talk too much about diversity or leadership. ","This guy was awesome. He answered each question very well, demonstrated humility while talking about a ton of leadership experience, spoke very confidently and concicely, knows about how CYC helps small businesses, has an interesting background.",Excellent candidate with great perspecitve on himself as well as the community. I believe Colin has the potential to be a great asset to CYC in his leadership potential as well as willingness to improve businesses and organizations.,"I think she's a good person, but not good for CYC. She's going into grad school, but she didn't seem to have any leadership experience, and the teamwork that she talked about, she never really mentioned her contributions. She also never really talked about small businesses or addressing how CYC tries to help with that. She had some vague notions about wanting to help people, but I didn't think it was super well defined.","Becca has a good understanding of the what it's like to work on a team, and her core value heavily aligns with CYC's mission. She has a diverse skillset and likes working on diverse teams.","Thida is a very good candidate. Well spoken, understands the problems of small businesses super well, and I think she's very smart. She doesn't have a ton of leadership experience, but that's because she does a lot of extra working. I'm not worried about that - she has a lot of self-awareness and would do good in leadership roles.","she seems very well put together and people oriented, while lacking some of the leadership experience was noted as a negative last semester, you wouldn't guess it from the interview. ","Lillie is a really good candidate, and I'm between recommend and strongly recommend with her. Her mom is a small business owner and she really understands the challenges small businesses are facing. I think she's very smart, and she is definitely introverted and I worry a little bit about her leadership. However, she is aware of areas where she isn't a ""traditional"" leader, and I think she knows how to make her leadership style fit her personality. I think she's the kind of person we need in CYC, and with a little bit of mentorship, she'll be terrific!","The fact that Lillie is well-acquainted with the struggles of small businesses, as well as her desire to get to know others and assist small businesses with her analytical skills, makes her a good fit for the organization. I think she has lots of growth potential as well.","I like Sarah Ann, but I also know there's a lot of other really good applicants. She had some flashes that I really liked (talking about her mom's small business), but I didn't like that her example of a time when she went above and beyond was from high school (she's a junior who has done 3 semesters of co-op.). So I'd like to see her move to the next round, but I don't know if she'll be as good as the other applicants.","The interview was good, but not great. She seems to take care of checking the boxes, worked at a small business for 4 years, and only took on a leadership/orgnizational role 3 years in. ",,"He seems to have the main teamwork thing down, but didn't mention any other leadership experiences. Fine, not great is my takeaway from this one","This guy was just alright. His communcation was not super concise, he didn't seem to understand the struggles of small businesses or the importance of the work CYC does. He does have expereince of working on a team and does seem to be passionate about giving back to the community. Does have some technical skills. Really didn't answer the ""Why work CYC does is important""","I think that Connor had a lot of what we're looking for in terms of experience, an understanding of how he could help an engagement, etc. One reservation I had was that he didn't seem to understand that community aspect, and answered the third question in a ""resume-drop"" kind of way. Would be good to see how he does in case, though. Came a little late because of sign-in issues. ",I thought Rucheer was all-around above average from what I've seen. I was impressed by the latter half of his interview. High potential and seems smart but not wowed on a personal level.,"It's hard to tell if I like Rucheer, because he isn't a good interviewer. But I think he's a good kid. I liked his leadership stuff in high school, and he seems to deeply care about the community. He's had some relevant experience that I think would translate well to CYC , which is good for a first-year student. I think he should move on to the case.","He seems smart but missed the mark in every category IMO. He is relatively old and I do not have confidence that he will be a high-impact contributor right away, I don't know if he would fare well with diverse teams, I don't know if he would be a great representative of CYC and our culture. He is really nice but seems pretty below average.","academically strong, has professional experience","Clearly cares about the mission of CYC and about volunteering and giving back to the community. Spoke clearly, concincely, and confidently. Has expereince both working as part of a team and being a team leader. Some of her work experience examples were repetitive. Knows the value of diversity and is open to learning new things. Passionate about consulting and wants to go into it for her career. Only concern is her leadership response was eh.",She is very passionate about helping the community and she has good experince of working in diverse enviroment. She was very confident and clear in her answers. Her first answer hit all the right points.,Lulu is a very intellectually curious person. She seems to be a young leader in training and someone who is going to blossom with the mentorship that CYC can provide. ,"Displays drive to learn and growth mindset, very kind, could be more organized in her answers. ",Her answers were really brief and didn't brag about herself like she should in an interview. Didn't seem like she was ready for an organizaiton like CYC but does have an interest in consulting,I thought she seemed kind but her answers to the questions were very brief and she didn't elaborate on her answers. I didn't gain enough information about her from this interview to feel confident in advancing her to the next round.,"Terrific candidate. Smart, passionate about service, and already showing leadership into her first year. She needs to move on to the next round.",This is exactly the person I would imagine when thinking of an ideal CYC member,Grace is a nice girl and has a variety of experiences that make her a good candidate. I have some hesitations with her understanding of the work CYC does and she didn't explain super well how she would contribute to that,"She does not limit her learning and impact to her major of Microbial Research. She is demonstratedly willing to learn about new fields, work with others, and step up to lead and make an impact. She has prior experience working for several small businesses and understands the needs and challenges that owners face on a daily basis.","Amazing and extremely knowledgable candidate. So expereinced, in fact, that she might not gain as much out of CYC as an undergrad canditate would. Also graduates soon: this November","Ming is incredibly experienced and could bring a lot of knowledge to the table. She is so experienced that it could almost hurt her time in CYC; going through the introductory phase of CYC may feel a little but redundant and elementary to her. She is a PhD student right now, and she does not have that much time left. She is graduating in November so she would not have too much time. ",I would reccomend Sam to move on to CYC's 2nd round of interviews. This is because I was very impressed with his reasoning on why he wanted to join. I think he should have a shot at the case interview.,"This guy did not communicate very clearly or conciesly. I had a hard time keeping up with what he way saying. For a junior, he does not have very much experinece. I was not impressed with any of the responses that he had for the questions. ",Great potential and amazing attitude. Might not have the same high-caliber experience as other applicants but is a freshman so that is expected.,"I would say that Grayson is a very humble and nice guy, with a lot of interest in CYC and a lot of passion to get involved with the program. He wasn't very clear while answering some questions and was a little vague with his descriptions.","Well-rounded candidate with many experiences. Was a bit of a challange to hear the specifics of those experiences and how they apply to CYC. I'm sure the candidate has many more experiences that would apply well to CYC, however, the STAR method was not appied and as a result, those experiences were not well communicated and sounded vauge. If we had more time I might have reccomemded or even strongly reccomended this candidate, however, I didn't hear the details of the experienes he shared and so was not able to extrapolate that information to determine how this candidate would apply/work well with CYC.  ","I'd say that he is a great candidate for CYC just off his resume and his eagerness to be a part of the organization, and I'm sure he could be successful, but it was hard to pull details regarding his experience and what he could really contribute to the organization. I feel like he has a lot to offer, but he didn't show us much during the interview.","Very smart and has great communication and leadership skills, would work well on a CYC team, seems to have a lot of commitments so I'm a little worried about how much time he will commit to CYC ","Beckett has a profound ability and desire to learn quickly and be creative. He also demonstrates a great deal of caring for his community by already working with a nonprofit on a project related to air quality. In addition, he demonstrates very strong leadership abilities (as indicated by his swim coaching), which would likely make him a great potential future EM or other leadership role within CYC.","Good candidate, did really well answering the third interview question, little bit of an older candidate (junior), would like to see her move onto the case to determine her critical thinking skills","I think that Julie has a deep level of care and concern for her community and local business, so she'd be great to represent CYC's mission. I felt like her communication could be a bit more concise. ",Sheridan is a good candidate and I'm interested to see how he works on the case with others. I think hes very curious and seems like a good person.,"Yes, I would recommend him to the club. His answers were good, and he has past experience working on the business side of club from his acapella group. He was late to the interview, but it was due to tech issues. ","This candidate did not have too much knowledge about small businesses but has a great deal of technical skills and experience, communicated very clearly and concicely, has lots of experience working on a team, and definetly has strong problem solving skills",I thought Ashlyn was good but a little timid and hesitant in her answers. She seems to have a good amount of experience that she can bring to CYC which is good considering her age. I'd pass her to the case interview if we have the space,"Showed great examples of taking initiative to fulfill needs within her own community
Spoke about importance of getting connected to NCSU community, and how hard it can be to do that as an international student not in the US
Really nice, well spoken and consise, would have liked more elaboration on some answers, had to prompt for further responses on some questions","She is hard working and driven but needs to work on her communication skills.  However, she does have skills in working with various groups of people and values what CYC stands for.",,,"Great understanding of struggles small businesses face, well spoken
Impressive personal projects, seems like he loves to learn and take on new challenges",Good technical skills and adaptability to learn,"Great candidate, definitely should be in CYC
Took a gap semester to run her own small business, so she spoke about understanding and connecting with CYC's mission. Showed solid understanding of the struggles small businesses face
Used to be shy and quiet, and decided to take public speaking classes and engage in community more to get better. Showed ability to identify weaknesses and work on them
Started very first club at her high school, talked about being innovative and having the courage to pursue her ideas. Overall, great applicant, I strongly recommend",Very genuine and would be a dedicated CYC member,"Seems nice, answered all the questions really really quickly, without much elaboration
has her own start up, so has experience with running a business, but overall, just not that impressed","unique experience to bring to the table with starting her own startup, knowledgeable about the inner workings of small businesses, dedicated to a project ","Has worked in coworking space to partner mentors and businesses, so understands CYC's mission
not great interviewer, answers were very brief and lacked elaboration, but she seems smart and driven","seems like she has a unique experience with engaging with small businesses and has a desire to learn more, although she didn't mention much about how her values align with CYC and could improve on her communication skills","Very clear communicator, seems to have a guenuine passion for small businesses and helping them, will be able to commit a lot of time to CYC and is a younger candidate. Would really like to see her move on to the case ",She should move on,,,,
