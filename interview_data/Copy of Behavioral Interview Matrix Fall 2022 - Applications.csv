All the while enhancing my practical skills as well as knowing how my hard work will directly make an impact on the said business, is a HUGE responsibility which makes me excited and energized to find out of box, efficient solutions.

Growing up I was always looking for opportunities to work. After school or on weekends I could be found walking door to door offering to mow lawns, walk dogs, and other miscellaneous tasks. Since then I have started and run two of my own businesses, one teaching music lessons to middle and high school students, and the other restoring headlights on vehicles with oxidized or foggy lenses. I have learned a lot from my experiences working jobs directly, as well as in an administrative position. Developing and operating each of these businesses came with unique challenges and obstacles. This is what fascinates me about business, the balance between arts and science. It is for this reason that consulting interests me. After attending several career fairs I decided that consulting would be an excellent choice for me. I believe that consulting takes a delicate balance between analytical, objective thinking, while still requiring more creative, subjective approaches for a business to achieve their goals. After speaking with several members of CYC here at NC State and attending numerous club fairs, which CYC had a presence, I was able to learn more about the organization and am certain this is an excellent opportunity to practice consulting in the real world. CYC NCSU is a great way to get involved with several Raleigh businesses; each with a different obstacle or challenge for the CYC team at NCSU to help them overcome. CYC seems like a great way to gain experience and challenge myself working with real businesses, helping to solve the challenges that they face. After graduating I hope to use what I learned as a member of CYC NCSU to be a successful consultant and business leader.","As mentioned previously, I have several years of business experience; working both firsthand and administratively. I have run two businesses, one teaching music lessons, and the other working with cars. The prior has since become a non-profit, focused on allowing youths disadvantaged by the COVID-19 pandemic an opportunity to learn music free of charge through a network of qualified volunteer instructors. In addition to my business related experience I have also held leadership positions in organizations such as the NCSU Marching Band and the NCSU Formula SAE team. In the marching band I serve as trombone section leader, where I help run rehearsals and facilitate music learning. The role I serve on the NCSU Formula SAE (FSAE) team has been my closest experience to consulting in the real world. The team decided to add a dedicated business subsystem in 2021 to facilitate the acquisition of sponsors. In their first year of operation the business subsystem accumulated more than $10,000 in total funding for the team. After working on the inaugural team for a year I was assigned to be the Team Principal where I currently lead a team of ten students responsible for all business aspects of the team. Another significant goal of mine since joining the FSAE team is to increase diversity and minority representation in the team. Currently, the team is composed of just 15% women and 20% minorities. By working with a FSAE team member, also part of the NCSU WMEP organization, we hope to promote minority recruitment for the team coming up in October. I believe these experiences, both past and current, align with CYC’s values and expectations.

At the time, however, I didn't feel that my major of geology would be the best fit  for CYC's vision and goals. Having changed my major and developed a huge wealth of real world knowledge in multiple internships and positions, I now know that I would be an outstanding member of Consult Your Community.

Also, I know that your organization provides pro-bono services to minorities in the Raleigh area which is admirable, and I would love to be a part of that. Moreover, CYC would provide me with in-depth industry knowledge about businesses in general, which then, I could add value to the business I would be working for in the future. I saw on your website that your organization provides a range of consulting services such as strategy, financial modeling, product development, operations and technology, etc., which I have heard of, but never had the chance to apply it. Through this opportunity, I would like to apply classroom knowledge to real businesses in order to help them succeed and make a positive impact in the community. In addition to the technical skills that I can strengthen, I believe it can help me build my soft skills as well. Consulting doesn't solely rely on technical skills; soft skills play an important role as well. Communication skills is crucial. Consultants have to thoroughly understand the issues of the client's company, what the client wants, and how they can accurately serve them to the client's needs. If I had the opportunity to serve your organization, I hope to improve on professional development, make an impact in the community, and network with professionals.","As part of a minority group myself, I can bring a different perspective on how to tackle problems and implement solutions. This could increase the breadth of diversity in your organization, which will be highly beneficial when connecting with business owners from minority groups. Moreover, I'm always curious, and I enjoy learning about different aspects of business and current industry trends. I like to be aware of what businesses are doing throughout different times in the economy. Next, I could apply classroom knowledge into real world issues. Academics has always been a focus throughout my life, however, it's useless if I can't apply it to solve issues in business. Through your organization, I believe I could apply my technical skills such as Microsoft Office (Excel, PowerPoint, and Word Certified) to better tackle business problems and identify potential solutions. Also, my business chemistry is a Guardian. I'm detail-oriented, organized, likes to minimize risk and uncertainty, which makes me a great analyzer. Most importantly, I like to stay on top of things and not procrastinate. Soft skills such as communication and teamwork are all critical and unavoidable parts of conducting business and consulting. I believe that I'm a great communicator when it comes to being able to listen to people, understand their needs, and getting back to people in a timely manner. Moving on to teamwork, I love to work in teams and being able to collaborate with people because not only it allows me to create bonds with them, but it'll provide me with resources to complete our goals as well.

Every local business forms a part of an urban fabric that is inextricable from our experience in a city. Coming out of the pandemic, it’s obvious that these businesses are quickly being stretched to the limit. They’re always packed, short-staffed, and dealing with crisis after crisis. If I can do anything to help these businesses that have done so much for me, I’d love to do it. On a professional level, I want to better understand how businesses are structured and what they need to run. We’re constantly told so much about the value of entrepreneurship and its importance, but I’ve never once learned how a business truly works past the trivial structure of an owner and workers. Although I’m not actively interested in pursuing my own business, it’s a compelling option for the future, and it would necessitate my understanding of the mechanics of running a business. Working closely with small businesses would provide this. Additionally, I want to network with like-minded peers. The most valuable resource a person can have in their life is their network, and I want to begin building a network of people who are as passionate about creating change on a local level as I am.","I see myself contributing the most value to the strategy portion of the services that CYC provides. I love to research anything for hours on end, and no detail is too small to go unnoticed. Additionally, I’m passionate about geography and history. Industry analysis is thus especially compelling, because it would be the perfect place to put this talent to use. I’d be able to find and process details about the market that each business is in, but also think about how their location and history affects the services that they need. This ties in closely with the go-to-market and revenue modeling portions of a CYC engagement. The pattern-oriented nature of these activities would be perfect for me to analyze through the lens of history. I want to study a business’ past and understand the decisions that they made. This requires thorough research to see how they ended up in their present situation. I can also work well in a team. For an enterprise like this to be successful, every part of the team needs to be working together efficiently, and I have experience working in high-stakes teams. For example, my work experience at Dunkin’ Donuts helped me understand how to make the best of a high-stress situation and still create a quality product.

My heart was bursting after listening to the leadership team talk about the joy that this club brings because of the opportunity to serve non-profits in the community. What stuck out to me, though, was not just the passion the club has, but the diversity in majors, ethnicities, backgrounds, etc. that brought everyone together. This is the purpose for diversity and why it is so important at NC State and in our world. Diversity strengthens a group of people. No matter what your background was, you bonded over the fulfillment of service and teamwork to find the best solution to solving large business questions. Not only did your diverse backgrounds benefit one another, but also it was even more of a blessing to the specific nonprofit that you were serving. I value diversity greatly and I seek out opportunities to listen, learn, and embrace those around me, just like I saw and am excited to do at Consult your Community.

Immediately my heart jumped to a topic that I knew would go much farther than just a paper, it would be a resource to make a difference in my community. My senior thesis was on how to better support nonprofits that serve the homeless community. The aspect of consulting that I love the most is the “team focus model:” team, evaluate, assist motivate, frame, organize, collect, understand and synthesize. These nine rules of engagement have set a great foundation for how a team should best communicate and work together in order to find the best conclusions to the problem being asked. I have experienced both the strengths and weaknesses of teamwork in the three different sports I played in high school. I was blessed with the opportunity to be a captain of those three varsity teams, however my job was not easy. I was committed to building a strong community of girls who communicated well and pushed towards the same goal, winning a game. During my senior year of high school, I was tasked to write a senior thesis. Our teacher gave us freedom in the topic, but I didn’t want to just write a paper, I wanted it to be a resource to make a difference in my community. My senior thesis defended that nonprofits serve the homeless community in productive ways relative to the government. I have developed a passion for the role nonprofits play in our community. I want to bring that enthusiasm to CYC. I was able to get many sports teams involved to serve a local charity as a way to give back and as a way to build team dynamics. Last spring, I was selected to be in a servant leadership club after a competitive interview process due to my interests and communication skills. I also have an interest in consulting and have been reading about problem solving and overall consulting methodologies that can be applied on projects. I would love to bring those interests and skills to the team. I value teamwork and would bring my strong leadership skills to CYC. I served as a captain on three varsity sports in high school and I would love to contribute to a collaborative and supportive environment that brings out the best in everyone to produce value as a team.

In March of 2021, I was close to committing to NC State for college, until I was offered a position at Meredith College to play volleyball. While I valued an NC State education, I wanted to continue to play sports while I was in college. I chose Meredith because NC State had released a statement of uncertainty on whether or not they would be allowing club sports due to the global pandemic. I was excited to be on a team at Meredith, but also have the opportunity to take business classes in Poole College of Management due to the NC State -Meredith partnership. During the fall, I had a great season and was the only freshman elected to the SAAC (student athlete advisory committee) to represent volleyball at Meredith College and to serve my athletic community. However, unexpectedly, last fall the school had a different approach to covid on campus and in the classroom. While NC State had in person football games, classes, and clubs, unfortunately Meredith canceled traditions, had very limited student activities available, and the leadership discouraged interaction inside and outside the classroom. I approached both the Dean of Students and the Meredith President with “covid friendly” ways to build community - but the leadership encouraged me to transfer. Unfortunately, the October 1st application deadline had passed so I could not transfer to NC State in the spring. I continued my college education at Liberty University where the campus was open and it allowed me to learn and to serve. I am now excited to be back in Raleigh at NC State.

I was the team leader for the annual national computer science project in my senior year. My main aim was to use technology for the good of the community. So I went around asking several charities in my area about the problems that they faced and they all had one common problem: they weren't getting enough food. After doing some research I also realized that food wastage is a huge problem in India. I found that India wastes nearly 68.7 million tonnes of food annually and over 250,000 Indians die of starvation every year. My goal was to do something that reduced food wastage while simultaneously reducing the number of people who died of starvation. To accomplish this, I and my team built a website called BetOnBetter that connects large events with leftover food, to charities in need of this food. We used python, HTML and PHP for this. Further, during a visit to government-run schools in India, I spoke to the students there and they told me that they didn't have soaps in the bathrooms. So, my friend and I built affordable and efficient soap dispensers using common materials like bottles, corks and simple principles of physics. We then installed the dispensers. I have always felt a responsibility toward the community and have had a knack for solving problems. I want to join CYC to drive change in the community around me and help local businesses grow to their best potential.","I have always had a keen civic sense and am passionate about solving my community's problems using teamwork and collaboration. Being a leader and taking initiative have always been my strengths. Using my problem-solving and leadership skills, I believe that I can help drive change in our community. Being a keen listener, I will patiently listen to the problems that business owners in Raleigh are facing and will help in coming up with scalable and sustainable solutions to address their problems.

Over the past few years I have been developing a strong interest in business. Through my experience with horseback riding I have gotten to start my own business taking horses in training, teaching lessons, selling horses for a commission, and running summer riding camps. Through this I have gotten to build my own website, social media platforms, handle communications, and of course work with clients. I found this process to be extremely gratifying. As a result of these positive experiences I began to focus on business oriented classes during my high school years (taking high school personal finance and marketing and college level intro to business, macroeconomics, microeconomics, and financial accounting). These classes confirmed my interests and I am now pursuing a major in Business Administration with a concentration in Entrepreneurship. As I look forward and consider future career paths, I can see myself working as a consultant. I think that this will suit me well as I can work with a variety of people and use analytical skills in a multitude of ways. CYC would give me the opportunity to get real world applicable experience in consulting. I think that in this environment I would learn and grow not only thanks to the experiences but also from the other members of the club and their mentorship. I love that I would get the opportunity to grow in my own skills while also serving the greater good and helping small businesses in the local community. CYC would be a great stepping stone between my undergraduate experience and the next chapter of my life as I begin my career. ","At many times throughout my life I have found myself in leadership roles. I have been a member of the United States Pony Club (USPC) for eleven consecutive years. Through USPC I have participated in national competitions, frequently serving as team captain, and I have gotten the opportunity to mentor younger members extensively. At my family’s farm I was a self-starter recognizing the opportunity to grow the business during Covid19 when my school schedule freed up and people were looking for more outdoor activities. Though I had wonderful experiences in these leadership roles, what was perhaps the most profound was my work with the Robotics club. I joined the club despite not having any background working with robots or even tinkering around and building contraptions. I began by trying to learn as much as I could about the robot and the club’s organization and leadership. I routinely witnessed issues with the club’s lack of budget, so I began working to help fill in the gaps. I created a team social media to highlight club information and a sponsorship program to partner with local businesses. My efforts were very successful in raising money for the club and resulted in me being named Officer of Media. When the team went to convention I was asked to be one of five members allowed backstage, not because of my knowledge of the robot, but rather because of my ability to lead under pressure, delegate work, and keep the team cohesive. This experience taught me that leaders do not always have to be the most knowledgeable on a subject or set out with a master agenda. I believe that I could put my leadership skills and willingness to learn to good use in CYC during all aspects of the consulting process.

Watching her ultimately sparked my interest in studying business, and inspired me to create a food blog of my own.

As a freshman, I was fortunate enough to have a couple big team projects, but it only left me wanting to do more.

I have been a part of many work and social organizations that have developed my interpersonal communication skills. I spent three years on my high school's student council as a minor committee member and worked my way up to an executive position where I led a committee. When I joined my committee, I wasn't afraid to ask questions and reach out for help. I volunteered for tasks that interested me and spoke up when I thought I could take charge.

I've built on these communication skills throughout college as a member of the club sailing team. However, throughout college, I focused on exploring my interests in business and technology. The second skill I find to be important is my technical skills. I can develop web applications and contribute when dealing with high-level technologies. However, my studies in computer science have also shaped how I approach every problem, technical or not. I have experience in asking design questions, imagining creative solutions, detailed planning, executing, and improving. The third trait that would guide my work at CYC is my ambition.

CYC’s goal to bring ideas and strategy to local businesses is one that I deeply resonate with. Throughout my college career, I have become very involved in the Raleigh and NC State community through advocacy and philanthropy. As a member of NC State’s Student Government, I have strived to better our students and the university as a whole. My role as Finance Committee Chair and on the Appropriations Council has allowed me to personally connect with student organizations and make a tangible difference in their club through funding. As I continue in my education at NC State, I want to further my involvement and challenge myself with new experiences.

I have an outgoing personality, strong speaking skills, and a dedication to learning. Consult Your Community sits at the intersection of many of my interests, skills, and values. I am majoring in Fashion and Textile Management with a minor in Economics so I have academic experience and knowledge that would be useful to the organization. During the summer between my first and second year of college, I interned with the North Carolina Business Council where I helped plan sustainable business training models for women and minority owned businesses in North Carolina. These small businesses were interested in becoming B-Corp Certified. It was so interesting to help these North Carolina based businesses and learn about what it takes to be a sustainable organization. In addition to my internship and student government experience, I am a part of a Panhellenic sorority where I serve as our Director of Leadership. Sorority involvement has allowed me to give back and experience the Raleigh community through service and help shape my chapter.

As a relatively new resident of North Carolina, I am also interested in becoming more involved in my community and building meaningful relationships. The small-business community in my hometown, where my mother operates our business, is an exceedingly welcoming and tight-knit community that is always ready to help one another.

I was determined to find the CEO a solution; the future of her company was in our team’s hands, and we could not disappoint her. Through interviews and research, we realized that the root of the problem was the staff not seeing the progress being made, and we proposed a solution and implementation plan that would solve this.

I would also like to join Consult Your Community because I am passionate about helping small businesses. Over the summer, I interned at a small startup business called Finch in Asheville. For the first month, the only people working were the owner, the chef, and myself. I quickly learned how much time and energy small business owners, and their employees, have to dedicate to build and maintain a successful business–and how meaningful this work is. I brought my ability to adapt and maintain a positive attitude to each of my daily tasks, and I believe that this helped build morale in our small team of people. I also developed meaningful connections with customers as many people became regulars over the duration of the summer.

I learned how to proactively communicate with my boss and colleague, while also learning how to listen and learn from a team of two experienced adults. My participation in our team at Finch taught me the importance of collaborating in a productive and respectful way, and I will bring those tools to a Consult Your Community engagement. Collaborating with the owner and chef at Finch also showed me the importance of knowing that you are not alone in your work. At a Consult Your Community engagement, I would make sure that every person that I am working with or helping knows that I have their back. Over the summer, I also learned how to help and communicate with customers and cater to their unique needs while also working in a fast paced environment.

My research thesis, ‘Preparation of Activated Carbon from Waste Food Packaging Plastics’ is a ground-breaking work which targets solving these problems by converting waste plastic into Activated Carbon (AC), highly effective in filtering out contaminants from water/air. The scaled-up pollution-free preparation process is estimated to reduce the plastic volumes by 90% during conversion to AC. A mere 34 grams of AC can filter up to a gallon of contaminated water/air.

Being able to see local businesses with different markets and stages of development is an opportunity that I do not want to pass on. I feel like CYC is an organization where I could proactively help while also guiding me to my own goals.

","Coming in as an engineering student, I enjoy solving problems. I love applying knowledge from books or experiences to other challenging situations. In a CYC engagement, I think I would be bringing this love for problem solving along with new perspectives to the group. I also would be taking my experience with organizing small teams to complete a goal or service. A prime example would be when I organized a group of young teens to install recycled plastic benches into Cedar Falls Park and Oakwood Park.

I have learned to listen to all sides, collaborate/communicate effectively, and build on top of everyone's ideas. Through this my partners and I have been State & International finalists. Simultaneously, from DECA, I gained tremendous exposure on business concepts from creating mock financial statements for start-up companies to assessing the competitive advantage to ideating marketing strategies. This prior knowledge would be useful when assessing real world business problems. I also bring the value of management and promotional skills that could transfer to the consulting world. This was fostered as I became the  Co-founder of the American Red Cross club.  Starting from scratch me and my friend marketed the club reaching over 70 members. In our meetings we educated members on humanitarian aid, the blood shortage, and provided volunteering opportunities.

For example, in high school I volunteered as a Spanish medical translator at a local pro-bono health clinic where I primarily served underprivileged Hispanic women. The experience of serving under-resourced community members while also developing my personal skills in a hands-on setting was so impactful to me that I founded the Hispanic Outreach Club at my high school to bring these opportunities to others. As president of this organization, I had to expand my skills to encompass those used in business settings, such as planning events, delegating tasks, and improving engagement through marketing. When looking to continue serving in my new college community, I found that CYC’s mission of providing pro-bono consulting services to under-resourced women-owned and minority-owned businesses and nonprofits fit my personal mission perfectly.

In high school, I started a competitive Bhangra team in my community. I followed a loose business process such as recruiting members, marketing the team, and carrying out the purpose.  Recruiting members was a tough part of the process - similar to gaining employees for a business. To attract members, I had to sell the idea of joining a competitive dance team to friends and mutuals. I achieved this through word of mouth and social media. Word of mouth played a crucial role in the first months because there was no prior achievement with a brand new team to showcase. I spoke about the possibilities such as competing, dancing, and building a family if the individual were to join. Once I gained enough members, I delegated more roles which allowed our social media to play an impactful role to recruit further. Tik Tok was used to design a fun appearance by having members do the latest trends. Instagram was used to inform interested members and to update our community about the team. With these platforms combined, a strong foundation was built with not only myself, but other amazing people that joined. Now was the time to execute my mission. This included training the dancers, showcasing their talents, and spreading the Indian culture in my community.
