Explain your answer to the previous question.,,,"Very solid applicant with great resume and awesome skillset, not the most community driven and had more of a how can CYC help me not how can I help CYC mentality (not like in an arrogant way though)","Throughout the interview, Ishaan possessed a confidence and understanding that mirrored what I would hope to see in a member of CYC. He was able to lean on his strengths while also understanding his pitfalls, a skill that I feel CYC relies heavily upon. Furthermore, his problem solving skills seem to have been well developed through various experiences.","Natalie is very accomplished academically, well spoken, and demonstrates high involvement in her community of Asheville, however, she said that thee value of pro bono work was that it will help her get a better job, and she mentioned not having enough time to volunteer much.","Natalie seems like someone not afraid to reach out and pitch her ideas, she has experience working on teams and has clear motivations regarding family and business sentiment","Very smart and nice person, giving that limited english vocabulary may have inhibited some of the question answers I will give her benefit of the doubt but ultimately seems exceptionally busy already, no great leadership experience or client facing skills","Although Aries did have impressive previous experiences within certain fields and a large base of technical skills, she did not speak to the community aspect of CYC as much as I would have hoped. As arguably the most important part of CYC, this owuld be something that I would have liked to have hear slightly more about.","Very good applicant, articulates well with clear community impact and involvement, not many other commitments so time should not be an issue in meeting CYC demands, lower leadership but also a freshmen","Throughout the interview, Claire spoke to the prior experiences that she had, one of the largest of which was the fact that her father was a mathematician and her mother was an artist and small business owner. She not only made a point of emphasizing the importance of both the analytical and reative sides of every issue and her experience with both, but also in how she had already helped with a small business with regards to marketing and overall functioning.","Would be a great addition to the club, from her resume stuffs alone, to her really volunteer work with the big soccer clubs raising funds to her teamwork experience in FEDD and in high school","It seems lustina's biggest strength lies in her ability to pivot and work as a team, she has a motivation and previous experience with leadership in soccer. She presents herself well and picks up on social cues but sometimes lacked strong cohesive arguments but managed to get points across.","Very laid back and lower quality applicant from an answer standpoint, understands well what CYC does and has good leadership/experience but not the most driven academically or in a community aspect (only a frshemen though)","I thought he did a really good job presenting himself and what he can bring to CYC. He was very comfortable with the environment which is good that he could handle pressure. He was also very knowledgable about CYC, so he is passionate and eager to work.","Weilin is very passionate about volunteering, we were unable to get to any additional questions, we barely had time to finsiht he three required, but she went very in depth, and I think would thrive in a group case environment and would really give us an oppotunity to see how she would work in a team. She is very focused on CYC as a career starter for consulting so that could be a concern.",,"Alex seems excited about CYC, but his excitement seems to extend to any opportunity as he states he doesn't know what he wants. While he has held leadership positions before, he was not able to clearly explain what he did specifically as a leader of what qualities make a good leader. He only said that leadership is important and described the positions he held, not the work he did. Still, he seems capable so he could do well.",He seems very passionate and excited about CYC and reaching out. Seems like he would be willing to commit a lot of time and responsibility to CYC as a whole and especially an engagement. He is still a little lost in finding out what he wants but could be a great candidate to shape CYC. ,"Seems like he's very personable. Willing to commit lots of time to CYC. Sincerely cares about helping others. My hesitation is that I feel like I didn't get a good idea of his smarts, capacity to contribute to high quality engagements. Might be easy to have on a team but idk if he has demonstrated high achievement that will make a team much better.","This candidate showed a lot of promise and seemed increadibly passionate about voulunteer work. I could see him taking on a major role in CYC down the line and being an asset to the organization. Deffinitely should have the opportunity to showcase himself in the group case interview to see his tact in a team situation, I'm curious to see if he will withdraw or step up, I doubt he'll overpower the group though. ","My only concern with Aiden is he didn't mention a desire to work with businesses perse. He finds the mission of CYC compelling and wants to help grow the community through small business intervention. But, he doesn't have business experience and could potentially fill this desire in other venues. However, he demonstrates adept leadership qualities including adaptability, performance under stress/time contrainsts, and helping to bring others along with him. He cares about the work he does and sees value in CYC  helping to contribute to his personal career goals of working in public health.",Aiden seems to me as a very strong candidate for CYC. He has a lot ef experience in leading a team and contributing positively to projects and has an outstanding time commitment to extracurricular activities and motivation for CYC. Even though not being aware of too many details of small businesses he would be a great contribution to CYC. ,Extremely tied to the mission of CYC. Seems like she would be an excellent team member and could easily be EM/Leadership. Definitely want to see her in a case.,"Seems like she will fit in really well, very driven, has excellent communciation skills, she needs to make the case round","He took a lot of time to answer all of his questions, thinking beforehand. This was mainly concerning for questions regarding community and why to join CYC which gives high cause for concern. Nice guy but don't think I saw anything at all that stood out, even with regards to his achievement in other areas at school.","I thought that the interviewee seemed eager to engage with the organization and had the right motivations, mentioned volunteering but not a lot of specifics in terms of volunteering and helping others, he took a lot of very long pauses for the more important questions, didn't really stand out a ton","Really interesting guy, has a very diverse background and unique path leading up to his CYC application. Some of his motivations seemed unclear, but he says he's gone through a lot of personal reflection recently in deciding his life purpose. ",,"Lena is bright with initiative to pursue and make impacts in areas where she finds passion. She sees value in working with the local community and brings a unique perspective of developming communitities through small businesses. Her coursework in International Studies focuses on sustainable development, which gives her a lens for how business plays a role in societal development, which is close to the mission of CYC. While she doensn't have as much experience, she is a freshman with lots of time to grow and make contributions.","Overall, Lena seems like a great candidate. In the next interview, I would like to see some more confidence in her answers and speaking (which is understandable for a freshman).  She has a lot of room to grow in this club and I would like to see how she performs in the case interview",Seems like she has very high emotional intelligence. Genuinely enjoys helping others and her community. Really passionate about how CYC helps minority-owned businesses. Didn't get a lot though outside of her Exploratory position and hardly anything at all with regards to her academic/non-academic achievement. So I'm nervous because I still feel like there's a big gap.,"She was a great person to be around, but wasn't really able to communicate what she was able to do in teamwork, not too much communication in leadership, and didn't seem to have a great grasp of the community impacts CYC hopes to achieve","This canidate gave some fluffy responses that did not have much depth. She seems very intelligent capable of producing quality work, and articulates well. I would say she is overall borderline, she hit all the boxes with her answers but they were not super supstaintiated. She also had pink eye","Heesue seemed like a very good applicatant for CYC. She's only a first year student, but she has been involved in leadership positions before, both in high school and college. I think she is looking to join CYC as a way to give back as opposed to just using it to try and get a job offer. I think that as ashe gets exposed to more clients, she will develop a better graspof small businesses. The only thing that I am slightly concerned about is her ability to committ time to CYC over the upcoming years, because she seems like the type of person to take on too mcuh and get overloaded. But, I still think that she should get to the final interview round.",Overall not very impressive. ,"I've definitely seen worse interviews, but I really didn't feel that he was what we are looking for in CYC. He has some experiences with leadership that sound good on paper, but during his interviews, I really was expecting him to be able to talk a lot more about specific examples of how he worked as a leader and in teams. Additionally, I did not feel that he had an accurate grasp of CYC, the mission, and how we can affect small businesses.","Overall he seems like he is a strong fit, I couldn’t identify any metric that he does not qualify on. He is extremely personable and communicates his ideas very effectively. He clearly cares about volunteering and is a hard worker. He mentioned that one thing he likes about CYC is the ability to apply classroom learning for a real business. After asking us questions, he pointed out that it sounds like we get to try to work on a lot of different things and he seemed to like that.",SEeems like a strong canidate due to previous experiance with non-profits and business in general. ,I think he would be a good fit for CYC in general. He is high acheiving and hard working in all of the examples he discussed. Was able to clearly communicate effectively his points.,"They were super innovative, take initiative, and fit very very well with our culture of smart people who care about the community and others.",I really liked her as a person and I thinks she would genuinely invest a lot into this organization and is really passionate about becoming a consultant. I do have concerns with her GPA though and she also used improper forms of speech multiple times,"Nice girl, very sweet but very lacking in achievement and drive. A good member if we were bringing in a very large class with a learning curve not as steep. Used high school stories to answer questions as a junior in college.",Just seemed like such an awsome and intentional person. Really well spoken and had great answers to all the questions. Definently very driven by the cause of CYC and wants to really actively engage himself in things that would grow him as a person. Really likes the idea of consulting because he is really intrested in the business side of things. Also he seems to have been very long term commited and passionate about past activies such as boy scouts and really talked about the concept of pouring a lot into something and then passing in on to the next,Silas did a great job of answering the questions and being personable in the process. He would be a great addition to the CYC community and has high potential to take a leadership role in future semesters.,I liked him and was impressed that he was interviewing at a PHD student. I think he misses the point about cyc's community apsect. ,I think he would be an asset based on his previous experience in project management and working in the industry. He has a willingness to learn and be open to new industries. The only point of question is he didn't really touch on being into the idea of community service and why CYC is doing this to help community and small businesses. ,She's solid,"She's a freshman so I could tell that she was a  bit nervous with her answers and gave some surface level responses in the beginning.  However, towards the end of the interview once she started to warm up, she talked about how much community and volunteering meant to her and how that aided her in becoming a first-gen college student (ENGINEERING MAJOR LIKE WHAT). She demonstrates a passion for volunteering and really wants to develop a community in the Raleigh-area.  ",YASSSSSSSS,"Aaron shows a passion for helping small businesses within the Raleigh-area. He seems very academically and intrinsically motivated. He has a passion for diversity and inclusion and I think he'd be a great fit for CYC :) The only thing I'm worried about is the time he can realistically commit. He seems like he gets heavily invested in everything he is involved with while also being a CS major with a triple minor, which is amazing but seems like it may be a lot to add onto his plate.",I wasn't blown away with her interview. She's a freshmen so I think she should go to the case but again wasn't blown away. If she was cut I wouldn't be too sad,I thought that she seemed to be competent and a hard worker. Nothing about her interview really popped out to me (In a positive or negative way). She seemed to be interested in consulting. ,Loved her. She basically checks all the boxes. Lots of initiative and was involved in high-impact stuff in HS. Does not seem afraid to be a leader early on in CYC. Seems to genuinely care about doing something meaningful with her time in helping Raleigh small businesses. I want to get a better picture of how she will perform in a team and working on business problems -- which is what the case is for.,She has some really cool experiences in high school that set her up for wanting her to be in this club. It seems like it would be pretty well applicable to  what we do here. She was about average in terms of her interview answers but pretty good. ,"Felt very apathetic about this one. Nice guy but I don't really feel like I got anything substantive out of this interview. I wanted to hear more about his achievement and success outside of the really personal stories (death of family member, weight loss). Did not articulate well why he wanted to join CYC: ""Lots of things"" and that kind of fluff was throughout all his stories. He could be a good applicant in the future maybe but I want to see him get more college experience first.",I liked him and think he seemed intrested and potentially could be a value adding member. I will say I was slightly uncomfortable by how personal his stories where for the first two questions that he answered. I am not sure if i would consider those to be appropiate interview topics and it does instill slight hesitation regarding what he might say in front of clients. ,"Very engaging person, who I believe has the passion and drive necessary to succeed in the club. Will do very well on engagements, and could be a direct admit EM if needed.","He was a strong candidate in knowledge about more technical and software concepts. I think that he is very passionate about the mission of CYC, but all of his answers were extremely long winded ",She seems incredibly gifted and smart and like she would be a great contributor to our engagements. I have some worries about her ability to commit time (although she was assuring that she would make CYC a top priority) and her personality in a team setting (might be too overbearing). But I would really like to assess her in a case and she said she would re-apply over and over again if she doesn't get in this semester.,"Nupur showed an amazing capability of getting things accomplished and an impressive drive to learn new things. She would be a great addition to the CYC community if she can fully commit to CYC and everything that goes along with it (team meetings, all member meetings, etc)","Very unique and fascinating guy. I'm super interested in all of his extra work (he's literally a certified financial advisor and started his own landscaping business). Idk how much he buys into the community service aspect of CYC. This is what's holding me back from strongly recommend because at the same time, I think he could do really amazing and smart work for our engagements. Reminds me of some of the CYC members of old in just being very humble but smart. Would really really like to see how his brain thinks on a case but can't say for sure that he'll make it there because of my other reservations.","This applicant demonstrated many skills that are highly valued in CYC. At the same time, he scored a little low in the third category because I did not see a huge focus on alturism. For him, CYC is less about helping the community and more about the consulting experience and leadership experience. He does however recognize the importance of helping small businesses.","I would like to see what he could do in a case environment. He seems very smart, and driven, but needs to slow down, relax, and make sure that were hearing his thoughts well. Slightly painful interview","WIth regrads to Johnny's handling of the interview, he came in extremely well prepared and had answers to every question that was asked of him. The lartgest criticism I had was that he spoke quickly and tripped over his words at times, which are skills that CYC is able to teach to its members. He spoke to the drive and passion that he has and clearly understood the purpose and mission of CYC.",I think that she was a great candidate with a really strong passion for serving her community. Did not have  alot of instances of personally taking lead on something that ended successfully. Mostly focused on joining CYC to make new friends,"Super passionate about community service and super aware of the importance of serving minorities but showed little interest in the work we actually do; the business side and being an active member of a problem solving team. She wanted to make friends, but lacked interest in the work itself. ",I just loved everything he said I was so impressed with hour thoughful he was and how much team he seemed to have consistently spent thinking about where he falls in life and how his identity as a techy person can help others and also all his thoughts on food and culture. Also he had really well articulated answers. ,,Wowed by this applicant. Has a ton of awesome consulting experience. Very easy to talk to and professional,"Seemed passionate but not sure if he's entirely qualified, however, if he can make the learning curve, I think he would put in a lot of effort so could be a good team player","Varsha exhibited concise communication and a warm spirit. However, her answers to most of the questions were very limited or did not offer insight into the subject of the question. While she would be a kind a caring member of CYC, I am not confident, based upon her experience, that she would make significant contributions to organization. Her descriptions of working in other organizations did not show the extent of her work, and she did not display any circumstanes where she led others or worked with them to accomplish a goal other than group assignments for class.",I liked her and I think she is a person who really beleives in wht CYC does and is obviously very driven but the great social impact of things. I feel like some of her answers were almost too concise though and that it would have benifitted her more to elborate further. ,"Sarah has a lot of potential and shows real care for the mission of CYC. I think she would be a great team member, but could improve on communication. I think she has not held many leadership roles but has the vision of a leader and ability to contribute to CYC's mission.","I thought that this was a great applicant. She was very community focused and passionate about service. She didn't have a ton of leadership experiences, though, but I think she would be a good addition to a team especially with her detail oriented thinking.",I wouldnt put him in front of a client. Needs to develope his thoughts better and work on learning how to articulate them correclty,"needed a lot growth in terms of clear thoughts and communication, lacked a bubbly/intersted persona","Autumn is extremely well composed, demonstrates high levels of critical and creative thinking, is able to work with others and navigate challenges. While she is soft-spoken, she has taken strides to bolster her confidence in speaking up and regonizes the unique qualities she can bring as a quiter member of a group. She throroughly understands the mission of CYC and is excited about the ability to help the community through helping small businesses and their owners. She has served in multiple leadership roles, one of which includes growing an organizing successfully from 3-4 members to over 30! She shows great drive, acheivement, and commitment to her endeavors.","Autumn has a unique personality and demeanor, which would be a welcome addition to CYC.  She is a little soft-spoken, but has realized this and taken efforts to combat being overlooked by forcing herself to take part in difficult activities (public speaking).  I would definitely recommend her to move onto the next stage of interviews",Very strong candidate with awesome credentials. Very wowed.,"Communication was phenomenal and she had a clear track record of both service and leadership, despite being a freshman. Was clearly in the room for the right reasons, has experience working in diverse teams, and was well-rounded as well.",I like him a lot a lot. I think he is really passionate about helping poeple and really feels like he aligins with CYC's mission. I also was impressed how well he interviewed bc it was obviously last minute. I do remember though that last year some of his stories were a little bit more robust/detailed. ,
