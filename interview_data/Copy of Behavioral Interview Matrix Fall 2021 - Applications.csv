With Covid making it more difficult than ever to volunteer within local communities, I've really missed being able to get involved and make an impact in my community. Coming to college, this is something that I couldn't wait to do in my new city! Unfortunately, even after reaching out to several local organizations, due to covid restrictions, I haven't been able to get involved. Luckily, I have been able to satisfy my servant's heart a bit in the meantime by serving as the Circle of Sisterhood Delegate for Delta Gamma. Circle of Sisterhood is an organization that raises financial resources for entities around the world that are removing educational barriers for girls and women facing poverty and oppression. Although I've loved being in this role and working with such an amazing organization, I'm not necessarily working with the most diverse team, as we are all sorority women. I appreciate that CYC seeks to create diverse student teams, and would love to be able to make an impact with those who may be very different from myself. I absolutely LOVE what you all do at CYC. Helping local businesses succeed is a great example of sustainable service, as they will be able to reap the benefits of CYC's services for many years to come. I especially love that CYC focuses on minority and women owned businesses. Besides my deep desire and passion to serve others in my community, I am also interested in CYC for the consultancy aspect of the organization, as my dream job is to be a sustainability consultant for companies and brands. ","As someone who has always been passionate about serving others, I have expansive experience with service and leading others to do so as well. Whether that has been my most recent position as a Circle of Sisterhood Delegate, my high school's Key Club president, Vice President of Service for the Greensboro Junior Guild, or banding together a group of students to accompany me in serving breakfast at the local urban ministry before school. Additionally, my leadership skills have grown even more since completing and earning a certificate from NC State's Leadership Development Program where I was able to expand my knowledge and understanding of leadership in various areas including leading in diverse environments. Aside from my experience with serving and leading, my passion for helping others succeed and my ability to empathize with others are my main strengths when it comes to serving others. Additionally, I have excellent verbal and written communication skills and am extremely professionally mannered. According to the Clifton Strengths Test, my number one strength is Futuristic.

With the help of the group, businesses are not only able to strive in the long run, but communities around Raleigh and beyond will be able to continue growing. Being that I have grown up in Raleigh, I would like to give back to the community that has given so much to me. Raleigh is the place where I fell in love with helping others and providing services and support however and wherever I can. I am committed to giving back the most that I can to the Raleigh community.

Before COVID-19 I was a casual member of a few campus organizations. Now, with a sense of normalcy returning, I seek greater campus involvement with a deeper sense of purpose. CYC is the perfect organization to leverage my analytical skills and focus my time for the benefit of others. I want to make a significant difference in my community and I am particularly concerned about wealth inequality. The United States Chamber of Commerce has identified lack of access to capital as a significant obstacle for minority-owned businesses. I believe that organizations like the CYC are essential to helping to close the wealth gap in the United States. By working on real-world projects benefiting under-served groups I know my CYC involvement would make a concrete and positive impact on the greater NCSU community and in the lives of individual business owners. I also know that because CYC projects are real my involvement would require a level of dedication I am committed to giving to my extracurricular activities. Consistent with my strategic focus and desire to optimize my time, I believe I have skills and experience that seem suited to a student-run organization like CYC. On a personal note, I think involvement with CYC will give me a valuable perspective as I evaluate consulting as a potential career path.","I believe my diverse experiences both inside and outside the classroom would be extremely beneficial to CYC and CYC client engagements. As a Benjamin Franklin Scholar I have cultivated both technical and non-technical skills in my dual Computer Science and Philosophy majors. I have purposefully sought to develop deep and specific technical skills to complement my inquisitive and generalist outlook. I believe my ability to comprehend the “big picture” combined with my analytical ability to drill down to minute technical details would be extremely beneficial when trying to understand client businesses, their unique challenges, and the ideal recommendations and solutions. As a Resident Advisor and in my extracurricular co-op and intern experiences I’ve demonstrated great initiative, strong communication skills, and developing leadership skills. I believe these attributes would be valuable and useful in any CYC engagement.

Lila,Carroll,,lhcarrol@ncsu.edu,9193898884,Psychology,Sociology,College of Humanities and Social Sciences,May 2023,4,"Instagram, Get Involved (list of student organizations)","Curiosity is what makes me most interested in CYC. My grandfather started and owns a small, neighborhood pharmacy in rural NC, and he's so passionate about the development of his business at the various stages of its growth. This summer, I worked for a non-profit in Franklin County and was immersed in duties that forced me to come up with effective ways to provide services and opportunities for the local community, especially pertaining to the challenging time of COVID. I finally  got to experience a small piece of what my grandfather exhibits every day, and can certainly appreciate the devotion to excellence and difficulty of various ways to stay afloat as society and the economy transforms. I especially  like that NCSU has CYC because there are so many aspiring and unique small businesses in the Raleigh area that are incredibly overlooked. I imagine COVID has had a detrimental effect on many of these businesses and I’d cherish the opportunity to help out. Truthfully, I’ve really valued a well-rounded education at State and have taken many STEM classes outside of my major, but before this summer I’ve been slightly lacking in business experience. I’m sure CYC would be very insightful to working in the business world and a place to hone many skills while learning new ones, all the while helping toward an imperative cause in Raleigh. 
","I think that being a psychology major with a sociology minor, I can provide a unique perspective on business management. My classes in psychology and sociology have repeatedly expressed the impact societal pressures have on people and institutions in society. I would think being intensely aware of these pressures must be vital to a business, as survival in certain communities and societies vary from one location to the next. Establishing and analyzing what societal pressures are effecting, say, Raleigh small business owners, could be important to formulating a business plan. Additionally, this summer I got to use my knowledge of STEM and the arts to work for a non-profit and execute a summer camp for kids living in at-risk areas, as well as serve as a coordinator for a STEAM lab in Franklinton Middle School.  My supervisor and I spent a long time deducing what would be the most effective ways to connect with the community, relay the information we wished to share, and incorporate close-to-home social issues like domestic abuse, mental health, insufficient education, and sexual abuse awareness. This boiled down to a 6 day summer camp that primarily partnered with 3 small businesses in Franklin County who specialized in these areas. While working with the founders of these businesses, I gained a huge appreciation and knowledge for the difficulties they face but also their insistence to somehow share their services to the community despite hardships. It was very hard to step away from my investment in the people I worked with this summer and their goals, and I’d really like to experience that thoughtful and intentional environment again. In terms of being a member of CYC, I have always been a team player and love working with peers of all kinds. Although I work well in a team, I am very independent, open-minded, a quick learner, and passionate about things I invest in!

This is because the entire concept of business and everything that it encompasses is truly empowering. The premise that any one individual possesses the ability to build something from scratch that has the potential to impact people from all walks of life is simply inspiring. Pair that with the innate sense of human ingenuity that is inherent in so many people, and you’ve got something special.

However, while many of us possess the creativity and innovative spirit essential to pulling together a good business plan, too few of us have access to all of the resources actually needed to implement it. Ultimately, this is where my passion lies. I’m currently majoring in Business Administration with a concentration in Finance, with plans to go into Consulting after I graduate. In the future I hope to be able to work with clients to troubleshoot, problem-solve, and help bring their vision into fruition. Fortunately, my professional end goal aligns perfectly with CYC’s stated mission and I’d love the opportunity to help make a difference here and now, in this community.

Through CYC I also hope to gain a meaningful service experience. Growing up and being taught the importance of giving back, I was fortunate enough to get involved with some spectacular organizations including Together We Feed, One7 Ministries, and Habitat for Humanity, whose goals are similar to CYC’s in assisting under-resourced communities. I have grown tremendously from these experiences and I now see this as a chance to grow even more while deepening my connection to this city I now call home.

I look forward to the prospect of being able to use my talents and abilities to add meaningful value to the Consult Your Community team.","Over the years, my involvement in various extracurricular and leadership opportunities has helped to develop traits that I believe would be of great benefit to CYC as a whole.

First and foremost, I pride myself on being a critical thinker and a problem solver. One area where this skill often lends itself to be useful is in my role as a senator in NC State’s Student Government. When addressing any situation, my first instinct is to assess systems that are currently in place, then work collaboratively with others to identify problem areas and reengineer systems to be more efficient and equitable.

Additionally, by the very nature of me being myself, I’m a very people-oriented person who loves connecting with others. In whatever it is I’m involved with, I always try to develop meaningful relationships with people because this serves as the foundation for any connection that you hope to make in the future. This has served me well in my roles as a Poole Ambassador and Park Ambassador here on campus, and I hope to bring this same energy to potential clients through CYC.

Last but not least, I also possess relevant knowledge and experience to bring to the table. In recent summers I’ve made a point to expand my business knowledge by participating in enrichment programs at the University of Tennessee and N.C. A&T State University. Most recently this summer I participated in a pre-professional development program at Ernst & Young. While I’m grateful for these opportunities because of how much I grew, I still realize that I have so much more to learn and look forward to doing so.

What I love about CYC is that it provides the perfect platform to apply what I already know to benefit others while holistically bettering myself in the process.

Andrew,Beckert,,agbecke2@ncsu.edu,7046203865,Business Administration ,n/a,Poole College of Management,May 2024,4,Word of mouth,"I want to join CYC to gain real world business experience, gain greater insight into the consulting industry, and make a tangible impact in my local community. 
I am interested in business because of its universality. Whether it's a small farmers market near your neighborhood, or the largest Fortune 500 corporation - our global economy is run by businesses. The brands people support, the lifestyles we try to lead, they are all supported by business to some extent. I am interested in finding my place in the global economy. I have many interests, desires, and goals, so it is hard to determine a good course for my career. That is why I am interested in consulting, I can work in multiple different industries and see what I like the best.
However, I only have a vague understanding of what consultants do - all I know is that they have various engagements in differing industries. Joining CYC would give me a concrete understanding of what work looks like. I could also discover what elements of business I love the most. Right now I think I enjoy marketing and possibly finance, but perhaps I excel at supply chain management or HR. Knowing what you are good at and what you like allows for a significantly more fruitful education and career. 
Moreover, joining CYC would give me the opportunity to help my community in ways I never have. Being able to not just raise money, but launch a new website for a startup business (for example) and watch it grow as a result would be incredibly fulfilling and beneficial to many people’s lives. It would be a substantial contribution to society at a scale I’m unfamiliar with. 
","I see myself bringing creative, analytical, and iterative problem solving skills to CYC engagements, in addition to my leadership abilities.
I regard myself as a creative individual; I play guitar, draw, edit videos and dabble in photography. I love thinking outside the box and trying new things. I have a great desire to be unique and I often find myself trying to take the “road less traveled.” Whether that’s starting a speech in public speaking with an abrupt sound effect from the computer to gain attention or ideating fictitious marketing strategies to subconsciously captivate a target market, I love implementing bold, creative ideas. I think that this inclination could benefit clients and their businesses. A creative approach to problem solving is valuable.
I get the ideas flowing with my creativity, but in terms of execution - I work analytically and iteratively. I organize all my data, inspect it, determine connections and work from the bottom, up. Oftentimes I do not get something right the first time (a paper, proposal, or even a technique). I begin to reevaluate elements of the first iteration and systematically improve them to the point that the initial paper (for example) is unrecognizable from the final. This process of problem solving is incredibly thorough, which will be useful in real world situations where mistakes can be quite consequential. 
I also consider myself a good leader. Every job I’ve had demanded leadership - from raft guiding to leading four day long camping trips in the Blue Ridge Mountains. I have come to understand my leadership style and I began to refine and enhance it. I often lead by example and I value kindness, but I also know how to be direct and assertive. 
I believe these leadership qualities and problem solving skills will be of good use at CYC.

In high school, I volunteered frequently so I could give back to my community. My experiences include volunteering at elementary schools to teach robotics and promote STEM learning, organizing special needs events, and helping setup fundraisers for charitable organizations. By joining CYC I can be of service to local businesses around me, but more importantly, build a special relationship with the business owners and help them achieve their goals.

I'm also a minority, and my father used to run his own business when he immigrated to the United States, so I know what it is like to be ""in the shadow"" and not receive the support and recognition that other people or businesses get. This experience has also instilled a passion in me to help those who are discriminated against, overlooked, and/or disregarded. This is one of the main reasons I want to join CYC; they work hard to provide for and support those who are overlooked. 

Another major reason I want to join CYC is because of the members in the organization. I went to the club fair the first week of the semester, and so I got to meet them in person. They were very friendly and answered all my questions. At the virtual interest meeting, I saw that the members were genuinely passionate about what they do and I would like to be a part of a community like that.","In sophomore year of high school, I started my own graphic design business. I am no artist by any means, but I learned to use Adobe Illustrator and became pretty good at creating desktop or phone wallpapers, so I started my own business on Fiverr, a freelancing website, where people could hire me to create a personalized wallpaper for them. Through that business I learned a lot. It of course wasn't a complex business, but it taught me how to manage my finances, communicate with clients, create an appealing portfolio, price my product, and manage my time well. Managing my time was the biggest thing I learned; I had no boss or schedule, so I had to know how to prioritize my tasks and get them done in a timely manner. I believe my experience running my own business, as well as experience constantly communicating with clients, will prove to be useful if I become a member of CYC. I will be able to talk to local business owners and understand their problems on a more personal level, thus helping them more.

Last summer, I became an intern at TurnUp Activism, supporting the launch of a non-profit startup with a mission statement to increase civic youth engagement. It was a small and growing startup, so they needed help to expand and prepare for the launch of their app. With my work with an activism organization, I was able to collaborate and talk with minorities and people whose voices were not heard.

The value that this organization provides to local businesses is immense and the ulterior goal of helping out local communities is something I was. Immediately connected to. I loved to see that this is an organization that allows one to learn and develop consulting skills while helping out companies and entities that are under resourced. One main thing that pushed me towards this organization is value creation and impact. As members get opportunities to work hands on with a company, learn their needs and cater to their issues, CYC allows every member to add value to a company and every member can create an impact towards the community. That is something which I believe even people working in the corporate world cannot say. Furthermore, I am also extremely interested in the field of consulting and CYC will give me a good insight into this field. After doing a strategy and product development internship this last summer, I realized the importance of business processes in developing strategies and found a great interest in it and I feel CYC is a great way to go deeper into that interest while providing value to stakeholders. I hope to provide value and serve the local community through this organization while developing my own skillsets in the process. ","I see myself bringing in value through my communication skills. I am great at compiling large ideas into a way which is comprehendible and concise. I also have great research skills which I hope to bring to the table. I have also had great experiences in my previous internships where I have developed skills such as research, and communication and I had experiences in different fields such as manufacturing, strategy and at NGO’s serving local communities. In my summer internship, I had to work on a product strategy project for a Pharma company, and for that I had to learn about a lot of concepts which I never understood previously, and from that position to working on providing new opportunities for the company, helped me understand my value as a good researcher and I had honed myself to be a good presenter. I also strive to be proactive in discussions and I try to make sure my ideas are communicated properly. This is important as communication is key while proving ideas that benefit stakeholders and making sure that it is communicated in the right manner and to the right people is extremely important.

I would see it as an honor, and my duty, to help them however I can. After hearing that they are businesses in my own neighborhood too, and I could not be more compelled to help them.

It was simultaneously both one of the most rewarding and draining experiences, he told me. Eventually, the man who sold the shop to him before came back and opened a competing restaurant and he was basically forced to sell it back to the man. 

Although my uncle and his family are doing well, other minorities may not get off as lucky. It’s because they likely lack the resources that others don’t, such as enough capital to start. Even if they do get off the ground, they succumb to larger, more established, generally white businesses that can out-compete their small start-up.  

This is why I think it’s so important to help local minority/women owned businesses and why I want to join CYC. To be there for people who need it so they can reap the sweet fruits that owning a business reaps and possibly begin generational wealth in their family.
","I would be suited for the diverse team I’d be a part of because of my 3+ years of customer service where I worked with a rainbow coalition of different people, my interdisciplinary education where I’m a Ben Franklin Scholar studying Computer Science & Economics, and my positivity and initative which would make me a great person to work with.

Every team-player needs to step up to show initiative sometimes. I used to be a barista at Dunkin Donuts where we were usually busy, but I remember one day we were particularly swamped, with a drive-thru time in the 400s (supposed to be ~200) and my manager was busy in their office with paperwork. Seeing the desperate situation, I stepped up and started organizing and delegating responsibilities to my coworkers. Saying who will stay on drinks, sandwiches, front counter, and so on making the judgments off of who did what best. From then on, we started to push the drive-thru time down, and by the time our manager came back the time was back to normal.


I like to play chess and in it there are always multiple options you can take, you need to select a few to examine and then choose the best one. Consulting a business requires the same mindset. When I’m playing I have to keep in mind all of the pieces, forgetting one can lead to disaster. In CYC, where you’re dealing with people’s livelihoods you have to keep the same attention to detail. When playing I remember to stay positive, you’re bound to have some low moments but it’s how you respond to those moments that determine the type of player you are. Consulting your community works the same way.

Bashir,Jabbour,,bjjabbou@ncsu.edu,9197448485,Accounting,NA,Poole College of Management,May 2022,3.5,Physical signage,"Throughout my work experience across several industries, one thing that has always stood out to me has been the positive effects of receiving outside help when trying to solve problems not in your area of expertise. I’m someone who loves to tackle tough problems, but I understand the value of seeking help when needed. The issue is that for some people, the avenues available for getting that help isn’t always accessible. Past that, its also difficult to ask the right questions when you have difficulty identifying the problem or knowing that a problem exists.

During my time as a manager at the Melting Pot I had the opportunity to work with several high-school aged students that worked on my team. These students were recent immigrants and spoke English at the elementary school level. Seeing the struggles they went through trying to navigate day to day life for themselves and their families was difficult enough but finding out that they were not aware of the resources available to them through government, community, and school programs was the kick I needed to get involved and begin to connect them with those resources.

This exact same scenario happens in front of us all the time in our own community on the business side. We are surrounded by hard working individuals with the desire to succeed, but lacking the ability or knowledge required to connect to the resources they need. There could be a great family-owned restaurant that serves amazing food with a line always out the door every night, but their table turnover rates are limited because they are bottlenecked by their payment processing or reservation system. Joining Consult Your Community would be a great way to connect with those businesses in our community to help tackle interesting business problems.","My greatest value that I could bring to a CYC engagement stems from the diverse array of background experiences I have had. I am a non-traditional student having started at the community college level, transferring into State as a biochemistry major, being involved in a motorcycle accident that resulted in me being out of school for three years, and returning as an accounting major. During my three years out of university I lived and worked on my family farm while taking vocational classes. I learned about electrical systems, implemented industrial automation systems using programmable logic controllers in the manufacturing industry, and worked full time in a fine dining restaurant.

Growing up, while the rest of my friends were attending summer camps, I spent summers at the manufacturing plant that my family owns watching, learning, and working alongside the team. I sat beside my dad while he designed solutions in SolidWorks, listened to my mom on the phone ordering raw materials, and helped the employees operate lathes, press brakes, and milling machines to fabricate parts. I drove the forklifts to load the finished machines onto flatbed trucks and rode with my dad across the country to deliver the machines in person to customers.

One of the most important skills for a consultant to bring to the table is the ability to function in a wide array of business environments. The only way to accomplish this is by having resiliency and a huge amount of diverse real-world experience. I have worked in manufacturing, finance, agriculture, and hospitality. While I’m sometimes disheartened comparing myself to students who have been able to complete their degrees straight out of high school, I know that all the setbacks and changes of plans have developed me into a professional able to succeed in environments that my peers likely have not experienced before.

From volunteering at Ronald McDonald House Charities to making cards for veterans or handmade blankets for hospital patients, I came to understand the importance of and enjoy the idea of giving your time, energy, and talents to those around you who need it. I came to believe this is truly something we are supposed to do. In all honesty, going into college, this service pillar of my life took a hit. With the isolation of the pandemic and stress of freshman year of college, I lost my awareness and action towards the needs of others. Eventually, I realized that this important service pillar had disappeared, and it makes a huge difference whether your life is oriented towards others or solely on yourself. And this brings me to Consult Your Community. Consult Your Community understands and lives out this idea of serving others wherever we are in life. Even though we don’t have a college degree yet and are still developing as leaders and individuals, we can still connect with those directly around us. There are real problems going on around us now, and we have the ability to come together and solve them. I have the time and passion to commit to Consult Your Community and would love to give a lot of myself to this organization.","I see myself bringing both skills and passion to a CYC engagement.

With this skill and others I will learn through my major, I will be able to help small businesses by optimizing their overall production process and giving them the tools to set their business up for success. With my psychology minor, I am better able to understand and think critically which will help in relationships with clients. Furthermore, I was in Air Force ROTC for my freshman year. Although I decided it is not where I am meant to be, the training did solidify my strong communication, organization, time management, and leadership skills. Beyond skills, I see myself bringing passion to a CYC engagement. One of my core values is accepting people as they are and supporting them without trying to change them. In the same way, CYC seeks to support the small businesses, supporting them in their uniqueness and helping only where they are needed.

CYC is the perfect opportunity to reconnect with volunteering while working with like-minded students and having a positive impact on my local community. I’ve seen so many small businesses close during the pandemic, and I watch those that continue to struggle through a slow recovery with a heavy heart. I’ve supported my local businesses as much as my personal finances have allowed, and CYC is the best way to do even more by giving my time, creativity, and brains. I want to use my love of statistics and passion for sustainability to elevate not just these local businesses, but the people behind them. 

I’m one of those weird people that gets excited by spreadsheets, graphs, and data, but I’ve never had the opportunity to combine this interest with my passion for service. I’ve definitely never had the opportunity to combine all of these passions while collaborating with other students and having the end result impact a lot of people. I know it’s going to be a challenge, and I’m excited for that too. My goal after graduation is to become a Sustainability Consultant so that I can help businesses and governments save money while reducing environmental impact. CYC is the perfect way to further develop the skills I need for my career while having a lasting impact on the place I call home. 
","My aim is to bring the sustainability dimension to every project I work on with CYC. The entire business world is shifting towards a sustainability mindset not just out of necessity, but also for better, long lasting success. I want to help a local business owner succeed not just so that they can make more money, but so that their family, employees, and customers can live better lives. I will bring value to CYC by always starting from this place of empathy. 

As an Eagle Scout, I know how to start a project from the ground up and lead my peers in a group effort. I have a background in working both as a team lead and in non-leadership roles, and I can recognize when I need to step up or follow my more experienced teammate. Outside of leadership, my most valuable characteristics are my determination and creativity. I simply can’t leave a problem unsolved, and I will come at it from every angle until I succeed, whether that means teaching myself a new skill or asking the right person for advice. It’s my determination and willingness to learn that has guided me through both failure and success, and it’s these same attributes that fuel the entrepreneurial spirit in local business owners. I want to succeed so that my client can succeed, and I want to do that while being sustainable and thoughtful. I aim to bring value to CYC through my previous leadership experience, willingness to learn, and holistic approach to consulting.

One reason is that Raleigh has been home to me for the past ~4 years, and one of my favorite parts of the city has been all of the local businesses that can't be found elsewhere, and I would love the chance to give back by using my marketing knowledge to help them solve their issues. The second reason is that I'm a highly motivated student who wants to do good with his skills, and I crave to be around other like-minded individuals so that I can grow my knowledge of the business/non-profit world with others who seek the same, therefore doing the most good I can for my community. CYC seems like the perfect place for me to be able to do both of those things my senior year.","As a senior in Marketing here at NCSU, I have learned several valuable skills through many classes and lots of hands-on work experience. Through my classes I have become very proficient in Market Research and Branding strategies, and from my two most recent jobs this summer, I worked as a social media manager for a Bitcoin mining company and as an intern for a B2B marketing firm that helped businesses (large and small) better themselves and solve their problems whether it be a lack of sales leads or having trouble rebranding. So given my ample experience in and out of the classroom, I will be able to provide all of the previously mentioned skills, but with an open mind and the readiness to handle whatever problem may present itself.

My most valuable trait is my ability to inspire myself and others around me to be the best versions of ourselves.

I’ve always had a keen interest in a club that not only benefits the surrounding area but also teaches its members key skills that can be attributed to later on in life. Working together with people is something that I look forward to doing here at NC State, and CYC provides me with the possibility to get to know people that share similar passions of mine which are business and conversing with others. I’m deeply invested in gaining first-hand experience with the team at CYC because I learn best when working with others. 
As an aspiring business major, I hope to utilize my previous knowledge of business in classes I’ve taken, as well as enhance my knowledge by exposing myself to the subject of consulting. I’ve always been interested in consulting, especially since I enjoy collaborating and solving problems with a team, but the chance to do so has been limited for me in the past. In addition, helping people in general has been something that I’ve always enjoyed, so the opportunity to give back to the local community through solutions that I can develop sounds extremely rewarding. 
Furthermore, the career-networking opportunities that CYC provides its members will allow me to establish my resume. The exposure that I can attain from joining this club is deeply beneficial to the career path that I aspire to be. If given the chance to join CYC, I hope to utilize their formal recruitment training from companies and apply that knowledge to a future internship. ","If chosen to be part of CYC, I am able to bring my communication skills. I find that the strongest skill that I possess in the business world is my expertise to talk and relate to peers. I believe that being able to effectively communicate, and with confidence, is a pertinent ability for a businessperson to have since you can tell a lot about a person’s nature based on how they talk. For instance, whenever I am conversing with someone or a crowd, I try and make sure that I speak clearly and look eye-to-eye with the audience-- this demonstrates my confidence and my ability to speak elaborately. Making sure that everyone feels heard in a conversation is something that I prioritize when talking because it establishes a sense of validation and open-mindedness.  
My communication skills go beyond a verbal viewpoint. I consider my written background to be quite efficacious since I try and write as clearly and concisely as possible -- whether this is in the form of e-mails, presentations, reports, etc. Having a strong skillset in writing demonstrates that one is professional in their work and is clearly able to communicate their written ideas. While writing, I always try to be as respectful and cordial as possible since it demonstrates that I am valuing the conversation. I prioritize being respectful to other clients and customers, especially in business, since it can create a beneficial reputation, and as a result, I see myself bringing these values to a CYC engagement.

As a current student in graphic design, one of the key concepts continuously prevalent throughout all projects is designing with a human-centered approach. This means that when there is an identified problem that needs some sort of solution, it is important to always work in tandem with the people we are designing for rather than separate from them. The diverse CYC teams curated to work with clients will not only allow me to do that—in regards of meeting and working with people that have incredible skill sets different than me—but will also expose me to the diverse perspectives and problems small businesses are facing in Raleigh right now. 

Additionally, I admire the emphasis on community building and diverse perspectives that are central’s to CYC’s purpose. I noticed that a lot of the businesses that CYC works with acknowledges the systemic issues that may hinder the visibility and success of a business, such as small businesses owned by women and women of color or individuals with developmental disabilities, and this upfront acknowledgment shows that this organization values all members of the community and the various demographics they represent. These aspects are incredibly valuable to me on a personal level and are characteristics that I always try to keep in mind when I design. 

In being part of CYC, I know that I can not only apply the skills of human-centered design in a way that is tangible but also be part of creating sustainable, empowering solutions for the small businesses that make Raleigh thrive. 
","I believe that I can bring a uniquely American and South Asian perspective and graphic design skill set to CYC engagement. As someone who is South Asian and grew up in both India and the United States, I think my experiences combine two very different cultures that shape the way I see the world. Being part of two distinct cultures taught me that I have to be adaptive to any type of change and always keep an open mind to learning because something that may be present in one culture may not necessarily translate correctly to the other. That perspective in combination with my skills in graphic design I believe has molded me to be someone that is always thinking of different ways to use my skill set to aid and learn from others. Graphic design is not only about aesthetics, but effective visual communication that is conscious of context, and I know that by working with other diverse team members with different backgrounds and skillsets, I not only get a chance to practice human-centered design but also learn from my peers and fill gaps in my own knowledge. I hope that by being part of CYC engagement, I can help businesses better reach wider audiences, but I also hope to walk away with learning something new from others as well. Learning is a lifelong process, and I know that having a mindset that is open to constant development is valuable to a successful team.

Living at home last year, away from NC State’s campus, left me feeling disconnected from the University and what it has to offer. CYC provides a unique chance to learn business skills and help the community simultaneously. After the impact COVID-19 has had on local businesses, CYC would also be a great way for me to give back. Through CYC I hope to find a meaningful way to make a mark on NC State’s campus, as well as with the businesses involved. 

In addition, I hope to become more familiar with the processes included in running and maintaining a business. While I know that marketing, analytics, accounting, etc. are all important to the functioning of a business, I’m excited to see firsthand how solutions are applied. Whether that be creating mock-ups for a social media campaign, or organizing a system for financial record keeping, I’m excited to learn about how these are enacted within an actual business. 

Lastly, I hope to take advantage of the professional development opportunities offered through CYC. Having access to professional partners from companies like Deloitte and EY gives a fantastic glimpse at how real consulting professionals operate. Additionally, the opportunities that exist for internships and interview practice are incredibly valuable for a student like myself, who one day wants to work in a corporate setting.","In future CYC engagements, I believe my experience in leadership roles has taught me to work well in team environments, which will translate into working with clients and other CYC team members.

I am not one to deflect work onto others when I have the capacity to complete it myself, and I am someone who can be counted on to meet deadlines and contribute to team tasks.

I also have confidence in being able to strengthen clients’ social media presence.

For starters, I have noticed that in my life most things tend to happen unexpectedly. That is why, after years of trial and error, I have learned to be prepared and quick on my feet, always looking for solutions. I have also understood that struggles, rejection and failure are as integral to life as success, and actually are some of the best learning opportunities. Because of that, I have learned to thrive in challenging, fast paced environments, which push me out of my comfort zone and allow me to grow. 

On the other hand, I have always enjoyed solving puzzles and being able to see the impact my work has on my surroundings. That is why in the community college I attended prior to NC State I worked as an international orientation leader. Being exposed to so many different cultures has proven to be an eye-opening experience, demanding huge amounts of flexibility, preparation and perseverance. However, it also turned out to be an amazing opportunity to learn new ways to go about life, and allowed me to think outside the box.

Because of everything mentioned above, I am thinking of pursuing a career in consulting and I strongly believe that CYC represents the perfect intersection between my passions and career goals. Most importantly, however, I am looking forward to contributing to the community. I feel so lucky to be a part of NC State and to experience such a radically different environment than my home in Italy, and I want to give back to the community and make my support known as well. ","The one value I believe I could bring to CYC is curiosity. I am an extremely inquisitive person, and the underlying search for knowledge and deeper understanding is the main driving force behind my life and personal experiences. That is visible through my love for problem solving, my perseverance and my willingness to go off the beaten path.

Even as a child, I loved making things work and/or improving them, and that passion has evolved with me throughout the years. From puzzles it turned into games, and then school. Now, as a junior in college, I am trying to channel this passion towards a more meaningful purpose. Putting my skills to work to help the community hosting me sounds like an amazing occasion for both personal and professional development. 

The second manifestation of my curiosity is perseverance. Because I strive to truly understand and improve what is in front of me, I rarely settle for “good enough”. I am detail-oriented, methodical, and once I am clear on my objectives and projects I deeply care about them. That is why, when I commit to something, I always give my full effort, regardless of the circumstances or the odds at hand. 

Another consequence of my inquisitiveness is that I am also not afraid of criticism or challenges. I have always appreciated suggestions, and I have realized that the real damage occurs when there are no challenges or communication. Looking at things with fresh eyes is always a good thing, and sometimes the seemingly craziest, unexpected ideas are the ones that actually yield the best results.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IcMmlYiJSt3OOZPAyAienlFxZj3vlwe4,Yes,,"White: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East or North Africa.",Female

I believe this experience will allow me to relate directly with our clients and better understand some of the business challenges they may face. For many small business owners, it is their primary source of income. I have seen first hand how some business problems can be stressful and take away time from being with loved ones. If my work with a CYC team can make their business processes more efficient, it can take away some of that stress and give them more time.

Growing up, I would always be at my parents’ business, observing my surroundings or doing the little tasks assigned to me. At the age of 14, I started working at my parents at the store when short on help. I understood how to operate a Point-of -Sale (POS) system early on and continued to explore various aspects of running a business. My curiosity about the assets, liabilities, and expenses piqued my interest in finance. 
	In the summer of 2019, I went to India as a volunteer teacher with the Uplift Humanity Organization. There, we taught underprivileged children about life skills and how to treat one another. After that, a group of business students, including myself, would go speak with local communities that were struggling financially about microfinancing and loans available through local banks. We also spread awareness about saving money, investing smartly, and making sound financial decisions. This experience really brought together my passion for service and business all in one. 
Between customer service, employee scheduling and speaking a different language in rural India, I recognized and learned from various communication challenges. Similarly, there may be communication challenges during a CYC project. It may not be speaking another language, but articulating your thoughts/suggestions or introducing a new software with associated jargon to the client poses its own hurdles. When running my parents business, I have trained employees, coordinated with suppliers and distributors, and established an inventory monitoring system.

These perspectives are rooted in growing up as the child of an immigrant family.  My perspective grew further when my father opened a bookstore that served the underrepresented Arab and African community in Raleigh, NC. When my father was forced to shut down his bookstore early last year, he came to me for help on how to sustain his business. Being able to help him keep his business afloat by helping him transition to an online business model gave me a sense of fulfillment that made me keen on pursuing a career at a company that would allow me to feel that same sense of fulfillment and accomplishment again. For me, fulfillment comes from helping underrepresented businesses and groups alongside like-minded peers under a company in which I feel represented, included, and valued. I am confident that I will see some of that diversity and inclusion that the company takes pride in at CYC.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-0alGHSUYBLWWJL-76yE1aQ4yNTCcopO,Yes,,"White: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East or North Africa.",Male

I have always had a passion for business, the prospect of building something from the ground up is what excites me and inspires me to study at NCSU. I look forward to working with businesses who deserve help the most and who share that passion, notably under-resourced, women, and minority owned small businesses and nonprofits. Last weekend, I attended the TiE Access business competition for women and minority owned businesses, and was able to meet the competitors and hear their pitches. I was inspired by the passion of the business owners and the dedication of TiE to serving others. I also noted the great things that can happen when business professionals come together to work towards a common goal. I can see that vision in CYC and I want the chance to work firsthand with business owners in an engagement manager role and take part in something devoted to change. This focus on corporate social responsibility and knowing that I’ll be contributing to ethical business practices is very important to me.  ","I have experience designing work management systems, advertising at every funnel level, conducting influencer outreach and copywriting, general consulting with clients, and working in agile scrum teams.

I help design workflow structures daily  through constant improvement and reworking of current systems with the ultimate goal of automation. I also bring team building and leadership skills from my time in the NCSU AROTC program where I worked in a high stress environment that required constant communication and problem solving.

However, the best part about New Bern is that it is built on community involvement. The summer of 2019 I was hired at a locally owned business downtown called Surf, Wind, and Fire. I had no experience in the workforce, but the owner saw potential in my natural aptitude for client-based work. It was in that store that I realized the shops I grew up visiting were so much more than I could have ever understood from simply walking in or shopping. Every item, every employee, and every operation in the store was intentional. There was a new world I began to fall into, which ultimately led me to pursue a second degree in business. After working in a small retail store for over a year, I have experienced the power a small business can have on a community. I am drawn specifically to this characteristic of intentionality, where every facet of daily operations is handled and designed for distinct reasons by a small group of people who are deeply involved in the company. Therefore, I was amazed to see CYC works to help businesses just like the one that became a home to me. Local stores and small businesses are the backbone of many communities, and I know how much work is needed to run them successfully. There is always something to be improved upon, which is all the more challenging for non-franchise businesses, and even more so for those owned by marginalized groups. I’d like to become a part of CYC to further my experience with small businesses and share what I’ve learned from being personally invested in one.
","I have substantive experience working in local businesses – on both the client-facing side as well as in upper levels of management – and a comprehensive skill set well suited for  a position in consulting. On the first point, I spent the entirety of my summer working for  a locally owned, small business – as referenced in my answer above. I began the summer  as a retail associate until both the operations manager and financial manager left unexpectedly. For the following 8 weeks, I learned to adapt, taking on a significantly greater workload; I was given the responsibilities of both financial and operations management positions overnight, working side by side with the owner to keep the business functioning while considerably understaffed.  I feel that with my experience running the operations and finances of a small business, I would be not just well prepared but an asset to CYC. On the second point, I am an avid communicator and close listener. I can make hard decisions when needed, but I also strongly believe that team decision making more often than not leads to the best outcomes – especially in locally owned businesses. From firsthand experience, I am aware of all of the moving parts that contribute to the success of small businesses and I am passionate about helping both small businesses and their owners structure and reach their goals. Lastly, I am deeply invested in the community that allows them to grow, and I am determined to use my own experience to help any businesses I get the opportunity to assist thrive.

In fact, my dream job is being a consultant and CYC can help me understand this environment. Furthermore, I am an exchange student from Italy, part of the International Business Dual Degree program and I think that this experience could help me to truly comprehend American businesses, how they are structured and which are the most common problems that affect them. In fact, I have a European academic background, so in my Italian University (UCSC) we mainly focused on how the European businesses are organized, which challenges they have to face, from a financial accounting or marketing point of view. I feel that CYC experience can complete my knowledge by allowing me to discover different points of view and more importantly, how the companies’ business problems could be solved through an American mindset. In addition to this, I think this experience can truly help me to understand how to apply my academic knowledge. In the academic world, especially in Italy, what is taught at university is extremely theoretical and thus it is not linked to the real world. Thanks to CYC, I could comprehend real business problems and figure them out with a team. In fact, another aspect I really look forward to is represented by teamwork. As an international student, I want to work in a team with American students to understand their perspectives and approach to solving problems. 
","My strengths that could contribute remarkably to CYC engagement are my problem-solving skills, analytical skills, and teamwork skills. Thanks to my internship experience in a factoring company called INTERNATIONAL FACTORS ITALIA S.P.A. – IFITALIA, I had the opportunity to develop sharp analytical skills. In fact, I was a Junior Business Controller and my primary task was monitoring and analyzing the monthly company’s commercial department performances, for forecasting long-term trends. Understanding data was a critical part of my job, in order to succeed in setting a reliable strategy for the whole company. I learned that the most important thing is always asking “Why?”. Going beyond the numerical data and seeking the main causes that led to that data. In fact, when I was analyzing data regarding the factoring industry in different parts of Italy and Europe, I understood that this business was highly impacted by the pandemic and this impact had different weights depending on the clients’ industries. Moreover, I participated in the monthly Marketing & Communication meetings with all the European branches and my role was reporting the updates of the Italian branch regarding marketing initiatives. In order to be able to do that, teamwork played a crucial role. I always had brainstorming meetings with the members of my business unit (called Business Strategy & Marketing). Together, we found the points to highlight, regarding Ifitalia’s monthly performances and which could become future challenges. It was extremely interesting comparing the factoring business in Italy to the other European branches and see if there were some common difficulties (especially regarding the pandemic) and how some countries overcame those challenges.

It was the first club in my high school to do something like this. With my passion for devoting my time to others, I was able to develop a club I fell in love with. Currently I am a freshman at NC State and I hope to continue my path of developing and helping organizations I believe in.

The experience of working with any of these local businesses is unmatched by the discussions and projects of a classroom. Further, I have discussed opportunities that often follow involvement with CYC; I am very interested in jump-starting my career while still in school.

Perhaps the most basic reason would be because I am interested in getting a job in consulting in the future, and I want to be able to gain experience while on campus. 

On a deeper level, I want to join CYC because they are focusing on helping smaller, often minority-led businesses in our community that truly gain value from our help. I believe that working with CYC would offer mutual value both to myself, and the clients. As a student in my third and final year of college, the majority of my NC State experience has been virtual and from my hometown of Winston Salem. With CYC, I believe I would truly be able to not only experience and make an impact on campus, but also throughout the community of Raleigh as a whole. 

I know that AMA also offers consulting opportunities with bigger firms through their internships. I can definitely see the value of working with large firms, especially as someone that will soon be looking for a job. However, I think that the work CYC does seems much more personally fulfilling. The small businesses that CYC helps are the backbone of their communities. I believe that my impact through CYC would be much more evident and would help me feel closer and more connected to Raleigh. 
","I believe I would bring clear value to a CYC engagement thanks to my academic prowess and my professional experiences. Academically, I am a Business Administration major with a concentration in finance. That being said, I am also taking marketing concentration classes, although I cannot officially declare two concentrations unfortunately. My dual interest in finance and marketing has helped lead me to an interest in consulting. I have always approached all of my classes with persistence, diligence, and an open mind. 

As a professional, I have held several titles that would bring value to CYC. I have worked as a coach which has given me an opportunity to see how passion coupled with patience can lead to a fulfilling and productive lifestyle. As a coach, I had to focus on the team goals and how I could best get the team there, while making it an enjoyable experience. I believe this will help me as a consultant, as I will be goal oriented while still prioritizing the experience of the client. 

As a sales associate in retail and a financial advisor with a Fortune 500 company, I have learned the importance of customer relationship management and servant leadership. In both of these positions, I always established the needs of the customers or clients before attempting to show them a product or strategy. As a servant leader, I often would inconvenience myself in order to make the client more comfortable or to make them feel appreciated. 

I have also worked as a graphic designer and a producer for a podcast, where I have learned many concepts of social media management, branding, and search engine optimization firsthand. This knowledge and experience will definitely transfer over to my future work with CYC and I am excited to put it to work.

Parker,Willett,,pdwillet@ncsu.edu,828-337-7197,Business Administration,German Studies,Poole College of Management,May 2024,3.5,"Physical signage, Get Involved (list of student organizations)"," One thing that all CYC applications have in common is their desire to get involved with such a reputable on campus organization. CYC can do wonders for networking and professional development, as well as meeting people on campus. I am certainly no different, I recognize the opportunities that CYC may offer to my professional endeavors. However, I have one motivation that reigns paramount to anything regarding my personal interests. 

I grew up in Asheville NC, a place revered for its opulent architecture and “hippy” culture that differentiates Asheville from the rest of the south. However, just like any other place in the south, Asheville is plagued with extreme amounts of racial injustice in all walks of life. 

I am white, but ever since I entered public school, my friends have always been African-American. Almost all of my friends grew up in low-income housing, and many of them grew up without a father figure in their lives. They always lacked the opportunities that their white counterparts had, which has perpetually bothered me since a young age. As we grew older, many of my friends started to get involved in drugs and gangs despite my efforts to persuade them to pursue another avenue in life. Unfortunately since I’ve been at State, I’ve lost several friends to incarceration and gun violence. 

Seeing my friends struggle so much has hurt me deeply. Not a day goes by when I don’t reflect on where we came from. However, my past has left me with an overwhelming desire to help those who need it most. Of course I want to get a degree and a good job, but most of all, I want to help those in minority communities escape the vicious cycle of racial injustice that has afflicted non-whites for centuries. 

","I would regard my main asset to CYC as my commitment to doing good in my community. Although I might not have the most impressive resume, or the most work valuable experience, I guarantee that I can compensate for that with my passion for the cause. I will never be able to fully explain in 600 words why I not only want to help people, but feel the need to.

Alongside my passion, I have various soft skills that could assist CYC members in providing valuable consulting services. To start, I have proficient communication skills that allow me to efficiently converse with all sects of the community. For example, when working at the Grove Park Inn, I am responsible for speaking to around 150-200 guests a night. These guests come from all across the world and I have to figure out an effective way to communicate in a way that makes them feel special. Consequently, this could be an asset to CYC in both client and team relations. 

Another important asset in my repertoire is my ability to develop alternative solutions for problems through out of the box thinking. My thought process is that there is never going to be an answer key to developing effective business solutions. Past experiences will help, however every business must be treated on an individual basis in order to provide the best consulting advice. 

In addition to my soft skills, I’ve spent time with Mercer Development recording and organizing the work we've done for clients. I’ve also prepared and dispatched invoices to HOA’s and homeowners, and discovered new business opportunities in our community. Furthermore, I’ve been working since I was 13, and I am no stranger to hard work. I have plenty of free time, I just need something meaningful to spend it on.

At my previous college, I was part of a work-study for the International office and I  would help students that were Spanish native speakers  and would have some trouble with English. Seeing their faces light up after I helped reminded me of why I  enjoyed being part of the International office. This increased my desire to continue to help people within the community because we all have different skills, and if we all work together it will create a sense of community. Additionally, I want to continue to promote some of the values I  have learned throughout my life. Specifically, teamwork and integrity. While I was studying abroad in Costa Rica, I was able to volunteer at a local recycling center and learned some of the volunteers were doctors and lawyers, but they didn’t make it known. They were simply there volunteering and talking with locals. I learned that when you volunteer or help, it is not about how many volunteer hours you will receive or the recognition, it is about the connection and peace that you are creating within the community. Here is where I realized the value of community. Everything holds value and we most cherish it, in any way possible. CYC is the organization that will allow me to continue to practice these values and stay engaged. ","The value I see myself bringing to CYC engagement is my diverse background, professionally  and culturally.

I can do everything from being a line cook to folding a shirt to answering phone calls. Most importantly, I learned the importance of customer service and how it moves a business forward. Culturally, I have been part of many global events and organizations  at my previous college that enabled me to learn about different cultures and backgrounds.

I was most intrigued by CYC’s mission of giving back to the Raleigh community by working with diverse small businesses in the area and educating students on how to properly consult these businesses. 
As a Resident Advisor at NC State, I have the opportunity to serve the residential community by facilitating programs, being a mentor, and providing resources to my residents. However, CYC would allow me to work within and outside of just the NC State campus community. In the same way that I work with first-year residents to provide comfort, I hope that I can branch out and have this kind of impact on business owners looking for that sense of security through providing them with high-quality consulting services.
Serving the Raleigh community through CYC will enhance the skills I already have and will be a way to learn new skills as well. While I am not so knowledgeable about consulting, I see value in learning how to do so because of the impact it can have on individuals, businesses, and communities when it is done correctly.
CYC will allow me to connect with highly motivated and career-oriented individuals. I will meet students from similar and diverse backgrounds as well as professionals working within various companies. I see networking as a valuable and essential part of the college experience which I can accomplish through being part of this organization.
I am very aware of the personal advantages that I will receive from being a member of CYC. However, what would stand out to me the most from being a member is the positive, life-changing, impact I will have on others throughout the process.
","Adaptability and flexibility are skills I have that have benefited me in various situations because it motivates me to never give up. An example of this would be me coming into NC State as a second-year transfer student amid the pandemic and learning to navigate through a new campus environment. Rather than choosing to stay behind, I adapted to the situation by joining a transfer student club to familiarize myself with campus resources and applying for a Resident Advisor position the following semester to involve myself more in the NC State community. I am confident that I will be able to stay motivated throughout my time at CYC while also motivating others to grow as individuals and as a group.
These skills can also be reflected through my work ethic which is a value essential towards becoming a loyal member of CYC. Time management and organization are major areas of focus for me daily to set my priorities and ensure the on-time completion of tasks. An individual that does not value a high work ethic is likely not going to value their clients. Through my engagement with CYC, I hope to ensure that no clients are placed on the back burner to provide the best consulting services.
Another value I see myself bringing to CYC is the passion I have for customer service. Through my experiences working in restaurants and as a Resident Advisor in different institutions, I have learned that exceeding the expectations of clients produces the best outcomes. For example, in some cases, I like to go beyond and use my multilingual ability to accommodate the needs of individuals in the case that language barriers are faced. Having good communication is one of the essential aspects of providing the best customer service.

Having the opportunity to be apart of the business process and to get a sense of the issues small businesses face behind the scenes will provide me with applicable knowledge and solutions that will be extremely valuable as I embark on my own entrepreneurship journey. It will also provide me with the environment to connect with others and build a strong network of experienced individuals whom could potentially be of importance to my journey. Additionally being involved in this community will enable me to apply and strengthen my creative problem solving and communication skills,  both of which are extremely important skills to possess when venturing into the world of entrepreneurship, as they are vital to the success of your business. You must be competent and able to come up with solutions to unexpected problems within businesses along with being able to effectively communicate with those you are working with. Furthermore, my father is a small business owner and I witnessed firsthand the detrimental effect that the pandemic had on his business. After all of the damage sustained by small businesses as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, it would be extremely rewarding to know that I am serving my community and contributing to the growth and success of small businesses by aiding them to get back on their feet.","My passion for entrepreneurship drives me to strive as hard as I can to help others succeed and reach their entrepreneurial goals. For as long as I can remember my ultimate goal was to own my business. The rewards that come along with succeeding within entrepreneurship are immeasurable. Financial freedom, time freedom, individuality/creativity, personal development and much more. I am a very honest, authentic, and open individual. I am able to share my ideas with ease, and love sharing positive input or providing feedback that can help businesses to identify their pain points and grow. Also, I am a critical and creative thinker. I possess the necessary problem solving and creativity skills that being a part of this community requires. I am able to think on my feet and come up with solutions that are out of the box. My optimistic mindset coupled with my ability to solve problems allows me to be a solution seeker rather than a problem finder. Moreover I am bringing forth some experience in business, as I myself have been in the process of launching my own business. Within just 3 months of creating my business social media account and website I was able to scale my following to over 10 thousand followers on instagram and generate an email list of over 200 customers. I am now working to foster that sense of community within my target audience in preparation for the business launch. Although it has been a trying experience, it has definitely taught me alot. I am eager to expand my knowledge to move forward with my journey and share my experience with other business owners.

Shreya,Vegesana,Shreya,svegesa@ncsu.edu,336-907-6620,Economics ,N/A,Poole College of Management,May 2024,0,Get Involved (list of student organizations),"Being a business student has been a really rewarding experience for me since my first year of college. I've been able to take classes that have broadened my scope of the business world and taught me lessons about professionalism, time management, organization, and being a good leader in our community. However, the one thing I've always felt lacking was work experience. Being an international student on a visa has limited my ability to go out into the world and gain experience that can only be taught outside the classroom. Other than volunteering for causes I believe in, and volunteering at non-profits where I try to learn as much as I can, I haven't found a good resource to truly learn much about what it is like to one day be a professional working in the business industry. When I came upon the opportunity to join CYC, it made me realize what a valuable tool this would be and how much I could learn and grow throughout the process. I've worked for non-profit organizations varying from being a cashier at a thrift store to helping hospital staff organize paperwork for their low-income patients. This has been really rewarding because every time I am a part of things like this, it makes me feel like I've made a difference, big or small, and at the end of the day, making a difference is all that matters no matter how you get there. Being a part of CYC would be an incredible opportunity for me to hone in on my specialized knowledge that I've accumulated in the last 2 years and put it into work that will help my community. It's also a way for me to learn from the people around me and become better at everything a business student should excel in. Consulting is also my intended career path. To have real time experience in this area while making a difference to the people around me is a once in a lifetime opportunity that I would absolutely love to be a part of. If I were to be recruited as a part of the team, I will always give my 100% and be willing to learn new things to better myself. It would be an honor to be a part of something that will not only help me develop professional skills, but to also give back to the community. ","During my first year at college, I was involved in various organizations like Alpha Kappa Psi, Global business brigades, and Model United Nations. Alpha Kappa Psi helped me develop some really significant business and leadership skills through my various leadership work with the brotherhood. It also has helped me manage my time effectively, organize in the best way that works for me, and most importantly, be a part of a team and work together towards a common goal. I was Secretary of Global Business Brigades for my freshman year which improved my communication skills and my ability to communicate with a large group of people. I would say my most rewarding experience however, was probably MUN. I got to debate with other students throughout the country on policy changes regarding various issues that are also prominent in the real world today. It’s helped me work on strategy and learn how to work with multiple people to come up with a solution that works best for those who need it. When I think of CYC, and the goal of the organization, I believe my skills will help me be an effective team player and my compassion and desire to work to give back to the community will make me a great fit for the organization.

I have helped start two successful non-profits in my community (Switchin’ Gears and Hope Recuperative Care) and I want to use this experience to help for profit businesses as well. I enjoy talking to local business owners about what problems they experience and how to solve them, and I would love to use this opportunity to apply this knowledge. Furthermore, my studies in Industrial Engineering have given me a love for solving complex problems and consult your community would allow me to help people using skills I am developing at NCSU. Additionally, consulting is something that I want to do in my career and consult your community will provide an excellent way to test out the field and discover a passion for it. Likewise, I have been able to make a meaningful impact in my community through my service with multiple non-profits which has presented me with many meaningful opportunities. Consult your community would be a great way for me to continue making meaningful impacts in my community which is why I am looking forward to joining it.  ","I will be able to bring expertise in problem solving in small businesses, working with a diverse range of people, and my teamwork experience. I have worked at Chick-Fil-A for three and a half years and during that time I have learned what to do and not do when running a successful business. Additionally, my classes in economics and the knowledge I have gathered from reading books on economics will be extremely valuable to CYC. The skills and knowledge I have learned are extremely applicable to consulting and will make me a valuable part of the team at CYC. Furthermore, my time at Hope Recuperative Care gave me ample experience working with a diverse set of people. Hope Recuperative Care houses homeless people while they are recovering from hospitalized injuries. In order to be able to provide guests at Hope Recuperative Care with the help they need I had to be able to work with a wide range of difficult personalities. A crucial part of consulting is being able to effectively work with many different people with many different personalities which is a skill that I will be excellent at. Also, I have substantial teamwork experience during my time at Chick-Fil-A and projects I have completed in school, most notably the team I lead that won 1st place at UNCW’s Engineering Design Day.

I am motivated by the thought of improving people and organisations around me on a local level, and changing policy, attitudes and structures on an international level. I understand that the small business owners we help depend on our work for their livelihoods, and take this responsibility very seriously. 

Additionally, as an international exchange student, I would bring a unique perspective to the team, contributing to the diversity of thought which is crucial in identifying the best solutions.

The first being that I want to gain experience, outside of the classroom, working with different businesses. I think this will help me learn more about potential careers that I may want to pursue as well as more about the business environment. I have always had an interest in business and I CYC will allow me to explore them further. I have never been a part of an organization similar to CYC and think that it is an amazing opportunity that I will be able to learn a lot from. Another important factor for me is being able to volunteer and serve my new community. All throughout high school, I was a very active member of the community through volunteering and I think this organization allows me to help the community as well but in a completely new way. Overall, I think that CYC allows me to fulfill both of my wants, by gaining business experience and being able to help the community. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to become a member of CYC. ","I think I will be able to bring a brand new perspective to CYC for several reasons. I am from a small town in Delaware, which makes my experiences unique from many people in the NC State community. The environment is drastically different from a beachy tourist town in Delaware to a downtown Raleigh as well as the way businesses operate. This will allow me to apply situations that I have encountered back home into the businesses that we will work with. Additionally, growing up I have always been surrounded by entrepreneurship and business. Since I have been in that environment for most of my life I think it will allow me to adapt and learn quickly. I will be able to learn my new responsibilities and become an important member of the team. My surroundings are what have led me to pursue a career in business and is a large part of why I want to learn more through CYC. I am very interested in business and would love to expand it through your organization.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=10Ypp8Bw3mwxX24IWJEyV9qbTwNijbg6r,No (I will add information in the space below as to why),"-I am willing to put in as many hours at neccesary, but Monday nights from 7:30-9:20 I have ENG 101.

Kristine,Huynh,,kphuynh@ncsu.edu,704-910-7035,Environmental Science,N/A,College of Natural Resources,May 2025,0,Student Involvement Fair (Virtual),"The reason why I want to join CYC is to connect with more of the community in Raleigh. The city seems like a place of many opportunities that pull people to the city and create their own life. Instead of supporting local businesses, it seems even better to help them grow. I had a few previous experiences with helping small businesses and farms. Of the glimpses that I saw, it takes a lot of work but also tremendous passion put into growing and running a business. I want to help them be successful in their goals and make their business more ingrained in the community. Hopefully, in some projects, working with the community will connect more students with the city they call home and increase more connections between the university and the city. I also wish to gain more experience with the running of a business. In the future, I want to be involved within the business industry or possibly open one of my own, which CYC could provide some valuable preparations in from working on projects to networking with the alumni. Some skills I wish to form include improving my interpersonal skills, communication, and teamwork.

As a student in SKEMA business school, I’m interested in finance and I enjoy my studies but I always wondered how what I learn could be useful for others. I was annoyed by the fact that I could not make remarkable changes in society during my years of work.
I want to join CYC because with this organization and consulting in general, I can see that I can make a real difference in the daily life of people and businesses. 
I want to join CYC because the work that I will produce will make me proud of me and in my opinion, an important motivation as future employees or entrepreneurs is to be proud of what we are doing in our job. The motivation is one of the factor to produce excellent work. In this situation, I can only be proud of helping and brings real solutions to small businesses that struggle even more so with this pandemic situation
Moreover, I could gain so much experience and skills that we cannot learn in class before entering into professional life. 
Finally, it is a big opportunity for me to enter a US organization, I am from France and it would be the opportunity to learn more about US businesses, their norms but also to meet more Americans from all majors within the organization.
","One of the main characteristics that I have is to be French, therefore I made the majority of my professional experience in little business in France. I will bring a different vision due to my different culture, for CYC it will bring a member that can display another way of looking at the situation. 
Moreover, I worked in small businesses and could saw that some problems are recurrent in this type of business. Since the clients of this semester are in major portion little businesses, I can be helpful to the organization because I have a sense of what a small business can go through. These professional experiences has been really important for me, thanks to them I strengthen my organizational and communication skills which are some of the values that I will bring to CYC.
Aside from my professional experience, I will bring value that I acquired and developed all my life. One of the core values that I will bring to CYC is consistency. In any project, consistency is a core aspect that will allow us to achieve any goal. Consistency is something that I had the chance to cultivate during my years of gymnastics along with all my life experiences.
Finally, I am a motivated person in everyday life but even more so when I am told that I can help real business during my years of study. I will share this enthusiasm to the organization which is, I believe, a wonderful opportunity.

The shows would depict the struggles of the small-business owners before Lemonis would step in and retool their entire business plan, often starting from the ground up. He focused on his so-called 3 p's of any business: people, process, and product. And with that, he would go and fix exactly that : the product, the process, and sometimes even the people running the business.
It was this show that matured my love of business, and has made me yearn to open my own business in the future. While I can't achieve this goal just yet, CYC offers me the chance to work with current business owners and help them achieve their goals. I believe that this experience will give me everything that I need to open my own business in the future. Working through the problems of business will leave me well-prepared to tackle these challenges if I encounter them in the future.
Furthermore, with the impact that Covid has on many small businesses, I feel that it is the perfect time to give back to the community in any way. If I am able to help a small-business owner recoup some of their losses during Covid, all while gaining business acumen, and making personal connections with business owners as well as my teammates, joining CYC seems like a no-brainer.","As I laid out in the earlier question, I am well attuned with a business strategy that circles around Marcus Lemonis’ 3 p’s: people, process, and product. People are taken care of in this scenario, as all these business owners are hand-picked by CYC, and are all in need of help with their small business. Where I think I could help is the process and product aspect of business. Bringing problem-solving, quick-thinking, and teamwork into the equation, I think that I can work with teammates to effectively solve any problems with the existing product and process. 
A lot of the time, making the product more appealing to the consumer, or making the process in which the product more efficient, will solve a lot of the issues with profit margins, and the monetary aspect of business.
Besides that, I am very trustworthy, reliable, and a good communicator, which makes me an ideal team member, and guarantees that CYC will be a priority to me. With that, I look forward to joining CYC and working with the small business owners to satisfy their needs. I look forward to getting uncomfortable and tackling challenging problems with my teammates. And most importantly, I look forward to giving back to the community during a time period where COVID has taken so much from a lot of us.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1etZqogIN1ITLW-Z3_LMkRF3H5Iyx96LH,Yes,,"Asian: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia or the Indian Subcontinent, including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand and Vietnam.",Male

After getting accepted into the Poole College of Management I now see I have the opportunity to correct my mistakes. This year I promised myself that I will be 100% committed to getting as involved as possible and leave no stone unturned in getting as much access to professional resources and experience as I can. Once I heard about the Poole Party I knew right then where to start my search. It was there I spoke to members of the American Marketing Association, Alpha Kappa Psi, the Finance Club, and many more organizations. One interaction however had stuck out with me more than the others. I spoke with two members of the CYC who were very friendly and engaging who were very thorough in explaining the responsibilities of the CYC. I proceeded to enter my email. After attending the first interest meeting I knew this club would be for me. I am eager to get hands-on experience in consulting in a professional setting and gain access to all of the other opportunities CYC has to offer.
