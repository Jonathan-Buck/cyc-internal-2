Explain your answer to the previous question.,,,"He had good leadership, community driven and good interview skills, the case is where we can see if the mental apptitude is there.","Seems like a strong candidate with diverse areas of interest, and has good experience working in teams.","He would do very well in a case, his behavioral was good but not great but has some very cool experiences and good leadership for a sophmore.","Has experience starting a business, understands the challenges of it. Seems like he has time to commit to CYC","Well spoken, but no substance to some answers. He is a freshmen and has defientely has strong interpersonal skills, good leadership and apptitude to learn/room to grow in the org. Could be a good freshemen but not the best behavioral interview skills",Seems to be eager to learn new things. Mentioned his relationship with an Arabic foreign exchange student that led to him picking up  and Arabic minor. His responses were not clear and concise and seemed at times he was shooting for anything that would stick. Is interested in consulting and took up a virtual externship with BCG to learn more about BCG.,"Showed up late for WIFI issues, kids a genius, interpersonal goods, very mission driven, needs to join","Overall, a well rounded candidate with great academic achievement. Was invovled in a variety of non-profit organizations and spoke with detail about them and his leadership style. Answered questions clearly and drove home his passion and the satisfaction in helping local busiensses.","Care about helping the community, but was not well aquainted with the mission of CYC","An okay candidate. I would not recommend because I don't think she was able to effectively communicate any of her strengths despite having multiple opportunities. Her Q1 was really rambling, her Q3 and Q4 were really shallow. She's nice but I really don't see the value in sending her to the case as a top 20 candidate.","Very interested in diverstiy and inclusion, has a real passion for these areas which is a huge part of CYC 's mission.","Rockstar behavioral. The personal fit definitely seems there with obvious care for the community demonstrated with substantive stories of her experience. Very involved. Only hesitation would be that she acknowledged she was very involved and time management is a challenge but when asked about it further, she followed up saying she definitely is willing to commit the time. We'll see but I want a case here.","Overall, great interview but showed but late and is probably leaving for France next year.","We had quite a mishap at the beginning where she tried to last-minute reschedule her interview to next Friday, then I called her to get her on the call and she showed up 10 mins late. Her interview was killer though in every respect. I have serious reservations though mainly about the fact that she is intended to leave next year for IBDD program. So she might only have 1 year in CYC.","Not great answers, not great interview skills, nice person though but should not move on","Seems like a smart person but I really did not like her answers; no concise communication, did not really answer the questions. Lacked substance especially on Q2 and Q3, as reflected in scores.","Great interview, should move on to case",During the interview he was engaged and responsive. His experiences to this point are a good foundation for him to further develop with in CYC. I beleive he has the potential to be an asset in engagements.,"He did very well in his interview again, going to be interesting to see how the case goes this time around","He seems very easy to get along with, very positive. He seems to care about the community and wants to develop his leadership. He didn't touch on the needs of a small business too much, but I'd be interested in seeing how his past internships gave him a diverse skillset. Definitely thought through his willingness to commit time.",Very thoughtful answers and really emphasized her passion for community service and her commitment to the organization if moving on.,"She was very thoughtful about the needs of small businesses, which was great considering she is only a freshman. It seems that empathy and communication are strong points in her leadership style. When she discussed her weaknesses, she also talked about how she actively tries to overcome them. Overall really great IMO","Ali struggled to communicate his ideas and didn't have a high performance background for being a Junior. Wasn't super impressed and didn't have any of the CYC ""IT"" factor","He was extremely nervous and repetitive with what he shared. The things he talked about were mostly pretty solid, but I didn't thin he fully grasped the breadth of what CYC does and how we impact the community. I also wasn't caught by any sort of leadership, ""going the extra mile""","I liked Maria and think she has a lot of potential and I can see a lot of room for her to grow. Shes super super smart, her parents own a small business and seems like she will work her butt off for something she wants to achieve. However I think she doesn't 100% understand CYC's mission and diversity. I'd like to see how she does in a case but if she needs to be cut for numbers sake with a recommendation to apply again I also think that would be appropriate","She's in her first semester and was super nervous, so I want to cut her some slack. But most of her responses were generic and didn't go into a ton of depth. I'm not sure if she actually has the experiences and didn't communicate them or if she just is a mediocre candidate.",She was extremely well spoken and able to communicate her impact to project. She seems like a strong leader and understanding of the CYC mission.,"She was super well spoken (not just for a first-year, but also in general). I think she understands pretty much everything about what CYC does, how we can contribute, and how we can affect the community.",Amrita was very succint and personable through her interview. She has a lot of skills and would be a high impact member to any engagement team. Highly recommend. Reminds me of Adithia. Understands minority issues. ,"Candidate has a strong skill set that would definitely be of use ot the organization, especially the analytical side. She was articulate and was able to demonstrate a passion for helping others, and seemed like she could fit into the organization",Seemed like a nice girl but has a ton of experience and specific interest in hard sciences and gene therapy. Struggled to see her fit within the organization both from a skills standpoint and a culture fit. Didn't really understand why she was interested in business,"Didn't really show why CYC specifically and didn't show a particular understanding of the service aspect of the organization, but has shown initiative towards promoting diversity and inclusion that may help her be. agood part of the organization","Lot's of Kathryn vibes here, really good interview skills for a freshmen, only drawback is only has 3 semesters left in US for CYC after this one.","Isabel seems to have a lot of potential to develop within the organization. Although, she plans on studying in Madrid her last 2 years. She has great communication skills and is able to hold an engaging conversation. A big plus when interacting with clients. I could see her doing many things in her short period within the organizaiton, if she joins.",Decent interview and applicant but senior with one semester I do not see her being an EM during the one semester she has left,"Being a senior, I believe she has alot of knowledge that could be beneficial to the small business in Raleigh. Given her extensive leadership experience and the copious amount of time she has available, Sarah, could be an EM in her second semester. She does admit to having an average business accumen, which I think would motivate her to learn and grow in that area.","Good interpersonal skills, interview  asnwers where not very strong for a junior, nice but do not think is worth the case","Tough one for me. She's excellent at communication and acknowledged it as one of her strengths. She had several opportunities though to talk about examples of achievement and I didn't hear anything that indicated to me that she would be high value on a project team. Fun person to talk to and super nice so the culture fit seems there but seeing as she's also a junior, I don't think she has what it takes to really help our clients.","Very good interview, not a lot of focus on the community aspect but very good experience and skillset, I think would be very good in a case setting and all around a great person",This guy hit the nail on the head with every answer. He clearly knows what it means to be a leader and has several experiences to back it up. He also sounded very dependable and like a very hard worker. He did not talk too much about WHY it is important to serve the community but I think it was just because we didn't ask a question specifically addressing that.  ,"Has really good communication skills, is very smart, seems to know the kinds of work CYC does for small businesses, didn't really adderess the service aspect of CYC though",She wasn't able to clearly answer questions and provide clear rasoning to support a strong score in multiple matrixes,"Really smart and has skills that would be useful for our club, kinda seemed just like a resume builder for him though",Paul provided excelent evidence regarding his abilities and traits that make him representative of what we want to see in a mamber of CYC,I'd like to see how Jaylan does in the case considering he is from a non traditional CYC background. I missed a good amount of the diversity and the community care focus of the questions,Talked a lot about diversity and inclusion and it's clear that this is an important value for him. He talked a lot about working on a team and making everyone feel included. He didn't to a great job answering the first couple questions but from everything he said during the rest of the interview I think he would be a good fit. ,"Amit seems like he could be a potential candidate again, but at this time does not seem like he is ready for CYC. He was not succinct and needs to practice interviening and gain experience before he is a competitive candidate.","He was not great at communicating, but it is clear that he cares about giving back to the community and he has several experiences of working with a diverse team.",Has potential used alot of buzz words but never elaborated on her responses. Very nice and personable to talk with just didn't show a clear understanding of CYC's mission.,"She didn't demonstrate anything impressive. She would mention buzzwords, but she didn't have stories of experiences to back them up. It was much more generic stuff like ""diversity is important"" or ""i understand the challenges of small business"", but she would never say what those challenges are or what the benefits of diversity are.",From a small town. Interview started off slow and didn't address questions properly but slowly progressed. Demonstrated his passion in serving the community and shows a willingness to learn new things. Comp Sci major working to repair houses in Appalachia. Diverse skill-set,"It was really difficult to rank Aidan. He started off really poorly and was rambling and had an awful answer to the first question. But then he got more comfortable and had great stories for the 2nd and 3rd questions, and I think he demonstrates a very astute understanding of the Raleigh small business scene, how CYC can impact that, and how diversity is important with that.",Candidate's answers were short and did not have much substance. Never got a sense of any applicable skills or commitment to diversity and didn't demonstrate why she wanted to work with CYC. Did not mention the service aspect at all and seemed more interested in the PD aspect of CYC. Seems like a nice person but cannot see her as part of CYC.,"She understands the struggles of small businesses from her personal experience with her father but didn't seem like she had much otherwise to bring to the table, didn't really answer the questions ","Has an interesting background that he was able to talk about in terms of how he would use it for CYC's mission, self-aware of how he could best use his skills in CYC, has a lot of teamwork and leadership skills to back it up as well. Good communication and articulation.",,Demonstrates strong organization and leadership abilities. Seems excited and passionate about the work she does. Had a hard time concisely answering questions. ,Seems to be a hardworker who has worked in team settings and is very outcome driven & wants to do her best but didn't speak much about what she would bring to the table helping small businesses,,"The overall quality that stands out on him is being humble and well prepared to the interview with questions. He mentioned a lot about why he wants to join CYC, and demonstrated the open-mind. He has a clear understanding of how beneficial of a diverse team. He also has good communication and well presented himself. ","She seems very passionate about what she does, whether academically or nonacademically. She also came across as smart, driven, and goal driven. I don't think she quite understands CYC's mission of helping local businesses but is definitely interested in the consulting and professional development sides of things.","She really wants to be a part of CYC -- this is her second time interviewing, and I think she came off as very excited to join the org. Definitely seemed more professional development-oriented, which isn't bad, but I didn't get as much of a community service perspective as I would've liked. She has a lot of diverse background experience that could be very helpful for different cases.","She definitley represents CYC's mission well. Seems motivated, driven, smart, and well spoken. ",Was the most coherent speaker I intereviewed throughout the process. Very friendly comes from a small town and understanding the neccessity of community. Very smart and I believe would bring a different skillset to the table.,Really personable and excellent communicator. I would have liked to see more talk about her technical skills but she's only a freshman. Also would have liked to see a better explanation of the challenges small businesses face. So I have some hesitations but ultimately would recommend her for a case. I can definitely imagine a scenario in which she kills the case and then go all the way.,"Great candidate, easy to talk to and full of unique experiences. Passionate about helping others and giving back to her community. Referenced her home country of Turkey and improving it. I believe she would be a good candidate for CYC.",Has a unique experience as an adoptee so is cognizant of the need for diversity. Very personable and great communicator. Didn't elaborate too much on the CYC mission but would be a great culture fit in CYC.,"Fun to talk to, but missed the mark in every category. I don't see her working well with a CYC team right now, her Q1 answer was a bad example I thought. I don't see her doing a lot to improve CYC at the organizational level, no real track record there. And I didn't see a strong personal connection to or excitement for the mission.",I'm a bit hestitant because I don't know if he fully understnads what CYC does. He is communitive and seems passionate about the volunteer work that he has done. Looking for prof development,Seems like a good candidate in a future semester. Didn't see any personal connection/passion for the mission. Talked a lot about DECA experience and showed some business aptitude. Good communicator but nothing special.,Gave very brief answers and lacked substance. Didn't seem to understand CYC or the challenges of small businesses.,Really disappointing because his resume is dank. Needs to really improve communication across the board. Seemed to have lots of examples of achievement but could not translate any of it into learning experiences.,"I thought this was a really strong candidate in terms of his drive to affect the community in a positive manner, especially for women/minorities. I don't know if he has the skills to be able to do that (he didn't say anything to wow me in that area), but that's what the case interview is for. I also think he would work really well in teams. He demonstrates active listening techniques, and he also seems pretty open to talking about anything, which I like.",He talked a lot about leadership and some of his experiences and everything he said was on point. He did talk a lot but eventually did a good job answering the questions. He talked a lot about diversity and challanges to minorities in society. He sent me a personalized follow up email which was great! ,"Pros: I thought he has a really great understanding of small businesses, the problems they face, and how we can address them. He crushed it on his response to the 3rd question, and he also was involved in a leadership role in a diversity club at his high school, which ws pretty cool. Cons: He didn't really have a response to the 1st question about teamwork. I asked a follow-up question and he avoided that too. IDK if he's ever really worked in teams, and that worries me.","He hit a lot on diversity and inclusion which was great, and his answer for the third question was spot on. He had a very logical and methodical approach to his answer. My only hesitation is that he did not talk much about being on a team and being a team player, even when he was directly asked about it. ","Honestly, I'm kind of bummed because she has some great intangibles, but I didn't get enough talk on leadership/teamwork to think she would be a great fit. I would like to see her in a case interview though, because I think she's someone that we should see more. Hannah is a design student, so she definitely had an interesting background with all this. I don't think she has a super strong business background, but that can definitely be taught. I was also a little concerned about how she works in teams, because she didn't go into a ton of details with talking about that stuff, but at the same time she has done a bunch of leadership roles and she did talk about the impact she made in those positions, so I think she might not have talked about it as much due to nerves. She mentioned being interested in bringing in more design students to the org and how she was initially concerned to apply because it seemed like only business and engineering students. That's something for us to talk about when we review our application process.","A lot of her answers were fairly high level, so I didn't get as much depth as I wanted. I don't feel like I can say much about her leadership and teamwork abilities (either positively or negatively). That being said, I'd recommend with hesitation because she was very enthusiastic, very easy to get along with, and is a design student.","I thought she was a pretty good candidate. She was very clear and concise in her communication, but I do worry a bit about her teamwork. Most of her examples were her connecting with individuals. While I think she definitely demonstrated that she did a good job in that, I did not see demonstrated leadership qualities within a team setting. And that is my hesitation. But other than that, I think she's got good skills and I think she has a great understanding of diversity and wanting to make an impact","I didn't get a ton of depth in her answers, so she was kinda middle-of-the-road for most grading points. She seems nice, she seems equipped to learn the business side, and she has nonprofit/NGO work under her belt, but I didn't feel like she was really outstanding in any individual category. I'd say recommend with hesitation because I feel like she might display more passion and depth in the case format, but she isn't a definite yes. Not a lot of info on her work in teams.","Wow, great freshman interview. While she didn't have a ton of impressive experience, she was able to take everything and very clearly explain how she's grown. I loved her self-awareness and humility. Would love to see if she kills the case, in which case it would seem like a lock for me.",Overall solid cantidate. Well spoken and clear,She should have made it last semester... That's all I'm going to say here,Very strong candidate - really addressed everything I'd like to see in a CYC member,"See comments. Seems to be very knowledgable and will give meaningful impact to our clients. However, I am hestitant about his time commitment and want to serve the community.","I could see this kid being the next Turck. Doesn't seem very outward about his care for the mission but I could see him working his butt off and being one of the best contributors to engagement work, so much so that I want to see his case. I have reservations about his time commitments though.",Very well-spoken and motivated individual with a good understanding of CYC's mission. Could see him in a leadership role early on.,Obviously a really smart guy. My only knock is I wanted to see more community service. Was close to a strong recommend. Really solid all-around. Probably should give him a case.,"Strong in all areas with exceptions in collaboration and understanding small businesses. Discussed working for different people but not WITH them. Focused majoritavely on students providing ""young customer"" insights. But, discussed students as stakeholder of Raleigh community, which was unique and insightful.","Talked alot about working in teams and his personal accomplishments within a team setting, focusing less on relying on team members for help.","Thoughtful, caring, and compassionate. Demonstrates a strong regard for others a willingness to help small businesses. Slightly concerned about where she would add valuable but seems intelligent and able to learn quickly.",Thida may lack technical business knowledge as of right now but throught the interview it is clear that she is adaptable and would be able to grow in this area in preparing for a case study and throught the group-case interview.,"She was my favorite person that I've interviewed (and I've done a lot of these interviews). She's clearly smart, she's a hard worker, she cares about making an impact and understands how that pertains to small businesses and CYC. And she also had a genuine personality and didn't seem ""canned"" or overly uptight.","Mary Louise seems like a great leader and team member who would be recieptive to learning new things and working with a diverse team. She was very prepared and was passionate about telling us that her accompishments were just hers, they were that of a collaborative team. ","Hilton was an absolute stud. He's only in his first semester, but he clearly is a leader, hard worker, and understands the power of diversity and has led efforts towards this end. I really hope he does well in the case because I think he would be a great addition to the organization",He answered every question fully and talked a lot about the importance of diversity and inclusion and scenarios where he notices a problem and decided to do something about it (he ran for student body president and own and made real changes). ,"I don't think he's interested in giving back to the community, I think he's just interested in trying to swing this for grad school applications. I thought he had some solid skills, but other than that, I wasn't impressed.","Didn't mention anything about service, seems to have skills that CYC is looking for though (research, data analysis)","Rithika was a really good candidate. She has a great understanding of diversity, she brought up some good specifics about Raleigh small businesses when we asked about Hillsborough St, and she also was very easy to get along with and is a hard worker. She would be a great addition to CYC.",Thought she was a very strong applicant and has good work experience that has prepared her for CYC. I recommend that she moves on,"For being in her first semester, Abisha was a really strong candidate. She's got leadership experience from HS, she has a strong understanding of diversity. I would like to see how she interacts in a team setting in the case...it was a bit difficult to gauge how she works in teams because she didn't go into a ton of detail about that. But I think that she did a really good job to try her best to overcome nerves and I think she should get a case interview. The case will be helpful because I have some questions about teammwork and I'm a bit worried that nerves make her go ""deer in headlights,"" but she deserves the opportunity to prove me wrong.","Seems very smart, and is a freshman so has time to build tenure in the organization.  Seems like she would be good to work with on a team"
